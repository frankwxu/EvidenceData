After recording the Foo Fighters' eponymous debut on his own, Grohl fleshed out the project with musicians like Nate Mendel and Pat Smear. The Foos went on to release a post-grunge classic in 1997's The Color and the Shape that established them as alt-rock staples, and they haven't slowed down since. With a bevy of GRAMMYÂ®-winning hits to their name, the Foos have proven through the decades that a classic alt-rock formula eschews trends and can't be imitated.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,0,0,0,0,0,/var/mobile/Media/iTunes_Control/iTunes/OnTheGoPlaylist_14069531493114055614.plist,0,2,0,0,0,0.0,256000261,0,pl.14451bd2b27e40d4b84cd2eef1f1f65f,https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/foo-fighters-essentials/pl.14451bd2b27e40d4b84cd2eef1f1f65f,1,0,1,0,976439554,Apple Music Rock,,7200,608660188,297020,97226,8715,0,0,,,,0,0,0,,0.0,,p.V7VY8EWh4QXQXdD,0,0
