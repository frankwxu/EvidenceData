It was originally a quotation by Jobs of Peter Falk’s Columbo character “Stay hungry, stay foolish” - Whole Earth Catalog, a magazine Steve Jobs loved.     20th Anniversary Mac https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Anniversary_Macintosh   one of the first Macs to be designed by Jony Ive, and it paved the way for the vertical design of computer that forms today's iMacIt looked like a movie prop.  The beautiful machine every 90s CEO would covet. April 1, 1996 marked 20 years since the day that Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne came together to form Apple Computer, and they decided to release the 20th Anniversary Mac to celebrate this momentous occasion. It featured a a TV/FM tuner, an S-Video input card, and a custom-made Bose sound system including two ""Jewel” speakers, and a subwoofer built into the externally located power supply ""base unit”. Upon unveiling, the TAM was predicted to cost US$9,000, which would include a direct-to-door concierge delivery service. At release the price was reduced to $7,499.  Problem was, it similar performance as the PowerMac 6500, a machine costing just $2,999. In the middle of its sales' lifespan Apple dropped the price further to around US$3,500, and finally upon discontinuation in March 1998 the price was set to US$1,995. Customers who paid full price for the TAM, and then complained to Apple when the price was so drastically cut, were offered a free high-end Powerbook as compensation.        TimeBand It's hard to imagine, but there was actually a time when the Apple freely shared its concepts with the world. In 1991, under the leadership of John Scully, Apple shared a bunch of design concepts with a Japanese magazine called Axis.   One of the strange products included in the spread was a wearable wrist computer called TimeBand.

WikiLeaks: CIA lost control of its iPhone hacking arsenal  http://www.cultofmac.com/470847/cia-used-malware-spy-iphone-users/ The Central Intelligence Agency has been using malware to spy on iPhone and Android users, according to the largest-ever publication of confidential documents from WikiLeaks — and the spy tools are now in the hands of others. “This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA.” As part of a covert hacking program, the CIA created a “malware arsenal” and dozens of “zero day exploits” to infiltrate smartphones, tablets and even smart TVs to extract data and turn them into covert microphones.

This week's stories 

 Apple’s retro rainbow logo might make a comeback There have been some clues earlier this year that Apple might be ready to embrace its old logo again. Apple renewed its trademark on the logo last year. Jony Ive also meticulously created a rainbow stage at Apple Park that used the rainbow Apple logo’s design. Although Ive was a fan of minimalist design, even he seemed to want to bring the rainbow Apple logo back. “There is the resonance with the rainbow logo that’s been part of our identity for many years,” Jony Ive recently explained.  Is viral FaceApp stealing your photos? Not all of them FaceApp has become incredibly popular in recent weeks. It’s gone viral. You’ve probably see the pictures everywhere. But there’s concern over what happens to your photos when you use the app, particularly since the devs are… THE RUSSIANS!  Apple might soon feature original and exclusive podcasts Apple’s growing services business will soon feature original podcasts, according to a report that, if true, amps up the tech giant’s battle with rival Spotify. Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported Apple executives are in preliminary discussions with media companies to buy the rights to podcasts. Spotify has spent millions of dollars positioning itself to be the go-to podcast app. It has acquired three podcast companies, including Gimlet Media, in the last two years to build up premium content. The Apple Podcasts app comes with iPhones and is considered the go-to platform for listening to podcasts. However, Apple Podcasts is merely a directory of links for users to download podcasts from other platforms.  Apple Once Caught Factory Workers 'Digging a Small Tunnel in a Corner' in Attempt to Smuggle iPhone Parts After photos of the colorful iPhone 5c leaked in 2013, the report claims Apple created a ""New Product Security"" team to monitor security at its most sensitive suppliers in China. At one point, the team reportedly topped more than 30. The security team is said to have uncovered workers going to extreme lengths to smuggle valuable components out of factories over the years, with some attempting to hide parts in crawl spaces, tissue boxes, shoes, belt buckles, bras, used mop water, under discarded metal shavings, and beyond.","This week: FaceApp, the mega viral app that ages your face, might also be stealing your data!

The “stage light” flaw, which others have dubbed “Flexgate,” is caused by the MacBook Pro’s delicate display cables wearing out over time. The cables wrap around the machine’s logic board and bend every time the lid is opened and closed. When the cable starts to have issues, it creates a weird stage light effect on your MacBook’s screen, and the repair is $600 dollars.

 3D Touch is probably dead iPhone’s ability to tell how hard someone is pressing on the display won‘t be a part of the 2019 models, according to multiple sources. It will apparently be a victim of Apple’s attempts to lower the price tag of future models. A recent Wall Street Journal article compiled several rumors about the next iPhone said Apple is considering trimming functions from its 2019 iPhones to cut costs That includes the force-touch module. And last year, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that no iPhone coming in 2019 will have this feature. His assertion was then echoed months later by an analyst from Barclays.  Health-tracking AirPods rumored for first half of 2019 Updated AirPods are supposedly on their way in the first half of 2019, according to a new report from Digitimes. They may have some impressive new features, too — including new health-monitoring functions that are “expected to receive enthusiastic market responses.” If Apple does include health-tracking features in its near AirPods, it will be interesting to see what they are capable of. A previous patent filed by Apple with the United States Patent and Trademark Office covers wireless earbuds with build-in sensors for performing heart rate monitoring and taking body temperature measurements. AirPods have been a huge hit for Apple. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks Apple sold 16 million AirPods units in 2017, the first full year they were available. He also predicts sales will grow to more than 100 million by 2021, and suggested suggested a full-on redesign could take place in 2020.  MacBook Pro ‘stage light’ flaw could hit you with a $600 repair According to iFixit, every MacBook Pro since 2016 has a design flaw that will inevitably require an expensive repair The problem supposedly lies in “delicate” ribbon cables that connect the screen with the display controller inside the main body of the laptop. Opening and closing the clamshell causes these to wear out and begin to tear. Taylor Dixon from iFixit explains it this way:  “The current generation of MacBook Pro laptops (2016–present) uses flexible ribbon cables to connect the display to a display controller board beneath the Touch Bar.

A petition on Change.org by Louis Rossmann asks Apple “to launch an extended warranty program addressed to this issue as soon as possible.” For a lot of folks the problem seems to appear just when the year warranty runs out...

 MoviePass Explores Reintroducing Unlimited Plan as It Tries a Relaunch Moviepass believes it has finally found a business model that will allow it to improve its service and continue to operate. This month, they've introduced a new series of plans, which vary in price depending on location. Next week, Itum said MoviePass plans to reintroduce some sort of unlimited program that would enable users to see as many movies as they wanted each month. He did not reveal pricing for that plan.","This week: why iPhone’s 3D touch is probably dead; new reports say AirPods packed with health sensors are coming in 2019; the MacBook Pro “stage light” flaw affects all models built after 2016, and could cost you $600 to fix; and the wild saga...",,5bc4a2f5a09271843349a12d9edde251,2D896BCB-E4E8-4EC2-B80F-2248D5A5CB95,"CultCast #372 - Health-tracking AirPods, Death of 3D Touch, and Moviepass LIVES!",public.audio,B07D6780-6872-4C9C-B4A3-27195021E637,http://thecultcast.libsyn.com/cultcast-372-health-tracking-airpods-death-of-3d-touch-and-moviepass-lives,,

  Mac division has ‘lost clout’ with Jony Ive and Apple design team   http://www.cultofmac.com/459078/mac-division-has-lost-clout-with-jony-ive-and-design-team/ Apple’s Mac team has reportedly “lost clout” with the company’s industrial design group and software team, claims a new report The picture painted by Mark Gurman as Bloomberg is a Mac division with a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key employees, and technical challenges — all conspiring to make the Mac one of Apple’s forgotten divisions. The article notes that ever since last year’s reshuffle of Apple’s design team, meetings between the Mac team and the industrial design team have become less frequent. It also notes more than a dozen engineers and managers working on the Mac have left over the past 18 months, with at least a sizable percentage put off by their lack of clarity about the “future of Mac hardware.” One possible problem is the lack of a singular vision driving the division. Instead of having one concept to work on, increasingly engineers are — in the words of one source — “asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable.” The result is that resources become more thinly spread than ever, while products ship later. Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales      Don’t worry, Tim Cook says new iMacs are coming  http://www.cultofmac.com/459110/dont-worry-tim-cook-says-new-imacs-coming/   The iMac didn’t get much love in 2016, but according to Apple CEO Tim Cook, killer new desktop Macs are coming. In a note to Apple employees, Cook assured staff that desktop computers are still “really important” and that they shouldn’t worry about future machines. “Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops,” Cook wrote according to TechCrunch. “If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap.

Base iPhone 10s Max, usually $1100, is $989 (only sim-free iPhones are discounted)   Base 11"" iPad Pro, normally $799, is $719.  256GB is down to $854 from $949.     Updated AirPods will supposedly land in early 2019  https://www.cultofmac.com/593894/updated-airpods-are-supposedly-on-their-way-in-early-2019/  Upgraded AirPods are on the way in early 2019, with a total redesign scheduled for 2020. At least, that’s according to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo   Our boy big Ming claims that the big improvement for next year’s AirPods will be the addition of wireless charging support.   He doesn’t, however, elaborate on what the major 2020 redesign is likely to mean for the AirPods.   He did say that the AirPods are Apple’s most popular accessory of all time, and suggests that the number of units sold will likely rise from 16 million in 2017 to more than 100 million by 2021.     Tim Cook promises Apple to those that ""push hate, division, or violence""  https://www.cultofmac.com/594150/tim-cook-promises-apple-wont-give-a-platform-to-violent-conspiracy-theorists/  During his acceptance speech for the Anti-Defamation League’s first ever “Courage Against Hate” award today, Apple CEO Tim Cook made it clear that his company won’t shy away from taking moral positions.   “We only have one message for those who seek to push hate, division or violence: You have no place on our platforms,” Cook said.   He went on to say “At Apple, we are not afraid to say that our values drive our curation decisions. And why should we be? Doing what’s right, creating experiences [free] from violence and hate, experiences that empower creativity and new ideas is what our customers want us to do,”   Cook pointed out that Apple has always banned music that espouses white supremacy from iTunes and Apple Music “because it’s the right thing to do.”   But what about all the other music that is filled with violence, hatred, and mysogyny.  It's not like Apple Music is full of only country music.        Our favorite shows of 2018!    Barry https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5348176/   Homeland https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1796960/   American Horror Story https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1844624   Arrested Development  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367279   Killing Eve https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7016936/   Rest in Power https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6719962/","This week: Apple’s new online store includes a 10% discount on ALL products, but there’s a catch….

But they say they do it because as batteries age they can’t meet peak CPU draw demands, especially when the battery is low. When this happens it causes the device to restart, so Apple added an algorithm that curves CPU demands as batteries age.</li> <li>STATEMENT:  <ul> <li>“First and foremost, we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,” the company says on its website. “Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love, and making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that.”</li> </ul> </li> <li>Apple also says it will come out with an iOS update in early 2018 that will give users more visibility into the health of their iPhone’s battery. Third-party apps like coconutBattery can also be used to check an iPhone’s battery status.</li> <li>Devices affected by the throttling include the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. Apple notified customers today that it will reduce the price on out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacements by $50, putting the cost at just $29.</li> <li>There was a rumor going around that Apple would only replace batteries for phones that didn’t pass a battery diagnostic test, but an internal Apple memo apprehend by French Tech Blog iGeneration states that the Genius bar should allow battery replacements for all who ask</li> <li>If you’re wondering if you should replace your battery, Apple can run a diagnostic on your phone's battery remotely – you don't need to visit an Apple Store.  Just contact their customer service via chat or email.</li> </ul>      ‘Steve Jobs’ could be Italy’s hottest new fashion line <a href= ""https://www.cultofmac.com/520805/steve-jobs-now-jean-company/"">https://www.cultofmac.com/520805/steve-jobs-now-jean-company/</a>  <ul> <li>An Italian clothing company going by the name of “Steve Jobs” has won its long-standing legal battle with Apple for the right to sell jeans with Jobs’ name on them.</li> <li>The company — founded by brothers Vincenzo and Giacomo Barbato — was created back in 2012 when the two noticed that Apple hadn’t filed for a trademark on the name Steve Jobs. They decided the tech icon’s name would be perfect for their new fashion brand and slapped it on their first line of jeans.</li> <li>Apple quickly filed a lawsuit against the Steve Jobs fashion company which uses a stylized J with an apple leaf at the top and a bite mark on the right side. According to la Repubblica Napoli, Apple lost its case because it unsuccessfully attacked the company’s logo itself, not Jobs’ name.</li> <li>The Italian court ruled that because the letter “J” isn’t edible the mark on the side can’t be considered a bite, therefore it’s not ripping off Apple’s own logo.</li> </ul>    Tim Cook will take home $102 million this year <a href= ""https://www.cultofmac.com/520693/tim-cook-102-million/"">https://www.cultofmac.com/520693/tim-cook-102-million/</a>  <ul> <li>Apple has had a great year, and CEO Tim Cook is being rewarded accordingly.

But they say they do it because as batteries age they can’t meet peak CPU draw demands, especially when the battery is low. When this happens it causes the device to restart, so Apple added an algorithm that curves CPU demands as batteries age. STATEMENT:  “First and foremost, we have never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,” the company says on its website. “Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love, and making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that.”  Apple also says it will come out with an iOS update in early 2018 that will give users more visibility into the health of their iPhone’s battery. Third-party apps like coconutBattery can also be used to check an iPhone’s battery status. Devices affected by the throttling include the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. Apple notified customers today that it will reduce the price on out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacements by $50, putting the cost at just $29. There was a rumor going around that Apple would only replace batteries for phones that didn’t pass a battery diagnostic test, but an internal Apple memo apprehend by French Tech Blog iGeneration states that the Genius bar should allow battery replacements for all who ask If you’re wondering if you should replace your battery, Apple can run a diagnostic on your phone's battery remotely – you don't need to visit an Apple Store.  Just contact their customer service via chat or email.       ‘Steve Jobs’ could be Italy’s hottest new fashion line https://www.cultofmac.com/520805/steve-jobs-now-jean-company/  An Italian clothing company going by the name of “Steve Jobs” has won its long-standing legal battle with Apple for the right to sell jeans with Jobs’ name on them. The company — founded by brothers Vincenzo and Giacomo Barbato — was created back in 2012 when the two noticed that Apple hadn’t filed for a trademark on the name Steve Jobs. They decided the tech icon’s name would be perfect for their new fashion brand and slapped it on their first line of jeans. Apple quickly filed a lawsuit against the Steve Jobs fashion company which uses a stylized J with an apple leaf at the top and a bite mark on the right side. According to la Repubblica Napoli, Apple lost its case because it unsuccessfully attacked the company’s logo itself, not Jobs’ name. The Italian court ruled that because the letter “J” isn’t edible the mark on the side can’t be considered a bite, therefore it’s not ripping off Apple’s own logo.     Tim Cook will take home $102 million this year https://www.cultofmac.com/520693/tim-cook-102-million/  Apple has had a great year, and CEO Tim Cook is being rewarded accordingly. According to a new report, Cook will take home a massive $102 million this year, composed of both his $3.06 million salary and an equity award of $89.2 million. For security reasons, the Apple board now stipulates that Cook use private planes for all business and personal travel. His personal security costs in 2017 were calculated at $224,216, while he ran up a $93,109 bill for traveling on private planes for non-business trips. Apple’s latest filing reveals that Cook’s top five lieutenants — including Luca Maestri, Angela Ahrendts, Johny Srouji, Dan Riccio, and Bruce Sewell — each received bonuses of $3.11 million. Including salary and stock options, this meant they earned around $24.2 million each, depending on if they stay at Apple long enough for all of their awarded stock options to vest. Apple does not reveal how much it paid to Chief Design Officer Jony Ive, who recently returned to his job running Apple’s design team after two years working on the Apple Park headquarters project. Tim Cook has previously said that he will donate his fortune (which currently stands at close to $1 billion) to charity — after paying for his 12-year-old nephew’s college education.     iMac Pro’s space gray accessories fetch silly money on eBay  https://www.cultofmac.com/521379/imac-pros-space-gray-accessories-fetch-silly-money-ebay/  The iMac Pro is the same size and shape as any other iMac. But to differentiate it from its more affordable siblings, Apple gives it an exclusive space gray paint job — and throws in space gray accessories to match.

16-inch MacBook Pro - 8 things Apple BETTER get right! 

 Apple axes 190 employees from self-driving car division Apple’s self-driving car project may be nearing the end of the road. Project Titan was reportedly greenlit toward the end of 2014. Apple hired hundreds of engineers setting out to design and build its own self-driving car. Numerous roadblocks hit the struggling project and the company reportedly changed the focus toward just making the underlying autonomous driving technology instead of a complete car. After rumors surfaced last month that the company slashed its workforce for Project Titan, Apple confirmed today that 190 employees in Santa Clara and Sunnyvale have been released from the self-driving car project.

Apple has been testing the new sleep-tracking technology at secret sites around Cupertino, a new report claims. And if it lives up to its promise, it could ship as part of the Apple Watch by 2020. The Health app for iOS has included sleep-tracking since 2014. However, it simply pulls in information from the Clock app’s alarm function, although third-party devices and apps can bolster the data.

  Apple will launch a new 15-inch MacBook Pro later this year powered by Intel’s next-generation Kaby Lake processors and 32GB of desktop-class RAM, according to a reliable analyst. According to reliable KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has a MacBook Pro refresh planned for later this year that will bring new Kaby Lake CPUs and up to 32GB of desktop-class RAM. It will be “the most significantly redesigned product this year,” Kuo says. Kuo doesn’t mention specific release dates for any of these machines, but he expects the MacBook with 32GB of RAM to arrive sometime during the second half of 2017 — at which point Apple could reduce the price of the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar. Kaby Lake will also grace the rest of the MacBook Pro lineup — and the 12-inch MacBook, too, Kuo claims   Former employee explains how Tim Cook made Apple boring  http://www.cultofmac.com/462906/former-employee-explains-tim-cook-made-apple-boring/  Tim Cook’s kinder, gentler management style is the biggest reason why 2016 was one of the most boring years for Apple in recent memory, according to a former employee of the company. Steve Jobs was notorious for inciting conflict and competition between top employees After Cook took over, he worked to eliminate conflict within Cupertino’s walls and made employees less passionate, claims ex-Apple employee Bob Burrough. ""Tim Cook fired Scott Forstall and aligned the executive staff so as to have peace. ...which is to say there is no conflict”     Apple Plans to Launch Original TV Shows Comparable to 'Westworld' and 'Stranger Things' By End of 2017  http://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/12/apple-original-tv-shows-end-of-2017/  According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Apple is building a ""significant"" business centered around creating original, including scripted television shows and possibly even movies. The content would reportedly be made available on Apple Music, like the already-announced projects Carpool Karaoke and Vital Signs. Apple executives have told Hollywood that the new original content will launch by the end of 2017, according to the new report. The move is looked at as a way for Apple to gain an edge against Spotify, and not a move to compete with Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.     iPhone 8 may pack frickin’ lasers for facial recognition  http://www.cultofmac.com/463022/iphone-8-may-pack-frickin-lasers-facial-recognition/  Apple’s next iPhone may come with new facial recognition technology and actual friggin’ laser beams, according to an analyst. By adding lasers near the front-facing camera, Apple will be able to depth-map objects, according to analysts at Cowen and Company. The camera could also be used for image recognition, enhancing security and fueling augmented reality.     iPhone 8 may have even higher waterproof rating  http://www.cultofmac.com/462289/iphone-8-may-even-higher-waterproof-rating/  Apple may be planning to make its next iPhone even more waterproof, according to the newest rumor “Apple’s iPhone 8 will feature the IP68 rating protection as part of drastic upgrades marking the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year,” reports South Korean news site, The Investor, citing an industry source.     Mavic Pro: The coolest gadget since the original iPhone [Reviews]  http://www.cultofmac.com/458941/mavic-pro-coolest-gadget-since-original-iphone-reviews/","This week: 2017 brings the super-charged MacBook Pro you’ve been waiting for—yes, another update!  Then, a former employee says Tim Cook's making Apple boring...  Is it true?  Plus: we get more...",,3fd9d18e8b4ebd000c982792ebcab7f2,2D896BCB-E4E8-4EC2-B80F-2248D5A5CB95,CultCast #267 - 2017 bringing another new Macbook Pro!,public.audio,B046941B-591C-4FC7-8AAB-BB25A45244DA,http://thecultcast.libsyn.com/cultcast-267-2017-bringing-another-new-macbook-pro,,

The invite promises “creative new ideas for teachers and students.” That could indicate the arrival of more-affordable Apple devices — like the new MacBook Air and iPad we’ve been hearing about. Apple is hosting the event in a high school, rather than on its Cupertino campus or at a convention center in the San Francisco Bay Area. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously claimed Apple has a more-affordable MacBook Air in the pipeline. The lightweight laptop, which has been looking a little long in the tooth for a while now, might get a Retina display and updated internals.

According to a new report, Apple has managed to reduce its manufacturing bill of materials (MBOM) for this year’s iPhone X-sized handset to a level much lower than that of its present flagship. The report suggests that Apple’s manufacturing cost for the new iPhone could be more than 10 percent lower than the $400+ dollars it pays for each iPhone X model. Apple will allegedly launch two new OLED iPhones this year, including a 5.85-inch (the same size as the iPhone X) and 6.45-inch OLED model, as well as a 6.1-inch LCD model. A plan to produce a 5.85-inch LCD iPhone has reportedly been suspended since mid-February, and could be cancelled altogether.

Moving to its own chips inside Macs would let Apple release new models on its own timelines, instead of relying on Intel’s processor roadmap. Making the move to ARM chips won’t be easy though.

 Why this week’s Apple PR blitz is brilliant [Opinion] Apple is reaching Hannukah levels of gifting this week with significant new hardware releases on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.   

MONDAY 

On Monday Apple released a new iPad Air 3 and iPad Mini 5 

iPad Air 3 The new iPad Air has a 10.5-inch Retain display, A12 Bionic chip, and first-generation Apple Pencil support. Performance-wise, it’s just as fast as the iPhone XS. This iPad replaces the older 10.5-inch iPad Pro that Apple’s been selling for $650 up until now $500 for the 64GB model iPad Mini 5 iPad mini now delivers three times the performance and nine times faster graphics. Improved Retina display with True Tone, wide color support, is 25 percent brighter than before. A12 Bionic processor first-generation Apple Pencil support Headphone jack! the same $399 price tag as the previous model.   

TUESDAY 

On Tuesday Apple gave some much needed spec bumps to the iMac, added better RAM and GPU options to the iMac Pro, and even dropped the prices on some of their high-end MacBook Pros! iMac iMac lineup has been updated with Intel's latest 8th-gen and 9th-gen Core processors, including a six-core 8th-gen Core i7 with Turbo Boost, and a monster eight-core 9th-gen Core i9 with Turbo Boost up to 5.0GHz (for the 27-inch 5K iMac). Apple says the new i7 brings a 60% performance increase for the 21.5-inch iMac, and up to a 240% for the for new i9 iMac. Radeon Pro Vega graphics options are now available across the new iMac lineup, including Vega 20 for 21.5-inch models and Vega 48 for 27-inch models. Apple advertises up to 80 percent faster graphics performance compared to the previous iMac lineup. New RAM and storage options are also available. Base iMac STILL include a 5400RPM mechanical hard drive…  Mac Pro now available with Vega 64X graphics and 256GB RAM Those with a need for speed can now equip the iMac Pro with an AMD Radeon Pro Vega 64X graphics card and up to 256GB of RAM for the first time. But be prepared to break the bank  Apple drops prices on some high-end MacBook Pros There’s good news for MacBook Pro buyers looking for a lot of storage: Apple has lowered the costs of its most-expensive SSD options. When upgrading your SSD, you can save $200 for the 2TB option, and $400 for the 4TB option. The bad news is that Apple didn’t change prices on any MacBook Pro SSDs that are 1TB or smaller. Putting a 1TB drive in a high-end 15-inch MacBook is still an extra $400 over the cost of a 512GB one, for example. The total package, with 256GB of RAM and everything else as standard, is $10,199. If you add every possible upgrade to the iMac Pro, not including software or a VESA Mount Adapter, it costs $15,699.   

WEDNESDAY 

 New AirPods deliver hands-free ‘Hey Siri’ and better battery life Apple’s newest wireless buds are here with a brand new H1 chip that allows for hands-free “Hey Siri.” They also promise better battery life in between charges, and even faster connectivity. An optional Wireless Charging Case is also available, but it’s not cheap. AirPods 2 have the same $159 price tag, or $200 with the wireless charging case. The wireless case a la cart is $79.   

 With New Unlimited Plan, MoviePass Swears It's Got Its Shit Together Thanks to MacDonald Ted for this glorious story. On Monday, MoviePass announced the new plan, which it is calling “Uncapped.” Under the Uncapped plan, subscribers can watch one 2D film a day, for $19.95 per month. A “limited time” offer gets you that same deal for just $9.95 per month with a one-year commitment. But can we trust MoviePass? Of course they’re playing games in their terms of service. A line in their user agreement gives MoviePass the right to throttle a user’s filmgoing options in the event that an individual’s use of the service has an adverse impact on “MoviePass’s system-wide capacity or the availability of the Service for other subscribers.”","This week: Apple just released so much new hardware, they had to do it over 3 full days.

Phone overuse makes millennials grow spikes on their skulls Doctors have noted a change in the shape of many millennials’ skulls: spikes are growing just above the neck, and researchers into the phenomenon blame it on too much cell phone use. However, this apparently isn’t some bizarre radiation-induced mutation, but is instead the skeleton adapting to the bent-over posture phone users typically adopt. The scientists were examining the growing prevalence on young adults skulls of enthesophytes — growths where tendons or ligaments attach. These typically become more common with age, but not a specific example at the base of the skull, a condition they call enlarged external occipital protuberance (EEOP).

But one guy came up, and presented what looked like normal keyboard, but as he typed, they realized it was extremely accurate.  They were shocked. How could this be.  How was this working. The UI developer had built AI techniques into the keyboard to learn how you type, and as you did so, it could predict which letter you’d type next.

Foxconn has managed to ramp up its output of the iPhone X from 100,000 to 400,000 units a week Digitimes says ""shipments of the device have increased gradually and will meet Apple’s demand ahead of the Christmas and New Year’s holidays, the sources indicated.” But even though production has ramped up, no one is quite sure how big demand will be. Will this be the most popular iPhone ever? KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, iPhone X preorders could exceed 40 million, and may even hit 50 million. However, Kuo has also noted right from the start that supply of the new device is likely to be constrained through the first half of 2018    Chrome Auto Refresh plug-in  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-refresh/ifooldnmmcmlbdennkpdnlnbgbmfalko   The candle that makes your house smell like a Mac is back  https://www.cultofmac.com/508933/candle-makes-house-smell-like-mac-back/ Mac and iPhone accessory maker TwelveSouth is bringing back its Mac-scented candle that flew off store shelves last year.

An internal Apple memo said this:  “Most keyboard-related repairs will be required to be completed in store until further notice. Additional service parts have been shipped to stores to support the increased volume. These repairs should be prioritized to provide next-day turnaround time.”  Keyboard issues were previously being sent out for repairs, which could take a full week.

Third-gen AirPods may be on the way before end of 2019 We may only just be getting used to our second-gen AirPods, but Apple is reportedly gearing up to release its third generation AirPods. According to a new Digitimes report, the AirPods 3 headphones will go on sale by the end of 2019. The main selling point of the new AirPods will be their smart noise-cancelling tech. AirPods are reportedly Apple’s second-best-selling new product of all time.

Here’s your first glimpse of that 16-inch MacBook Pro. Or not. Behold, we have appeared to have images of the rumored 16-inch MacBook Pro. All pulled form a macOS Catalina beta. A French blog this week published what it called a rendering for a new Mac laptop that was discovered hidden in a macOS Catalina beta. Skeptics, from Twitter to tech news sites, quickly tamped down any excitement by pointing out the icon’s similarities to the current 15-inch model.  2020 will deliver Apple’s ‘most impressive hardware’ in years 2020 will be the year Apple unveils its “most impressive hardware in some time,” according to a new report. Alongside big upgrades for iPhone, Apple Watch and Mac, Cupertino also is expected to deliver its first augmented reality glasses. It’s been two years since Apple introduced a major iPhone redesign. The Apple Watch hasn’t changed significantly since its debut. But 2020 could change all that. Bloomberg expects Apple to blow everyone away next year with huge upgrades and brand-new product lines.

But as is typical of Apple, Screen Time looks like it took a lot of work to get just right.     iOS 12 makes iPhones immune to ‘brute force’ unlocking  https://www.cultofmac.com/552919/iphone-unlocking-blocked-ios-12/  The just-released beta of iOS 12 can be set to partially deactivate the Lightning port after an iPhone hasn’t been used for an hour. This is a clear attempt to make useless the unlocking tools employed by law enforcement (or thieves).     Face ID in iOS 12 recognizes two different faces  https://www.cultofmac.com/552883/multiperson-face-id-ios-12-beta/  The first iOS 12 developer beta debuted after today’s WWDC keynote.

This week's stories 

 Latest MacBook Pro blows away its predecessors The top-tier new MacBook Pro employs a Intel 9th-generation Core i9 processor, which just debuted. It’s clocked at 2.4GHz with Turbo Boost up to 5.0GHz. This is Apple’s first 8-core laptop, and the promotional materials promises “40 percent more performance than a 6-core MacBook Pro.” Geekbench benchmark scores are now confirming that this macOS laptop is around 30 percent speedier depending the the tests look at. The multi-core score for this device is around 29180. Last year’s speediest 6-core version of the MacBook Pro topped out at 22620, indicating that its predecessor is 29 percent faster. The single-core score for the new model is around 5900, up from about 5350 in the 2018 version. That’s almost a 10% improvement. One YouTuber reported the new MacBook Pro is beating his base iMac Pro in some tests!  2019 MacBook Pro teardown reveals minimal keyboard changes Keyboard seems largely the same, though iFixit has confirmed Apple has changed some of the material used in the dome switch mechanism and keyboard condom. Steve Jobs didn’t want the ‘Get a Mac’ ads to be too funny Justin Long was recently on a episode of People Magazine’s TV show called Couch Surfing reciting why all the best Get a Mac ads never aired. Though 66 ads aired, apparently they filmed over 300! According to Long, it was Steve Jobs who kept the best ads off the air because they were just too funny. “One, in particular, I remember Zach Galifianakis played a drunken Santa Claus and I was dying to see this one,” Long said on the episode, which aired on Sunday. “Basically, Steve Jobs preferred when they weren’t super funny. It’s because he thought that would detract from the point of the commercial. He thought if people were too focused on humor, they would lose sight of the product.” But the commercials worked! Apple experienced a sales increase of 200,000 Macs after the first month of the campaign in May 2006.

Borsky began repairing Apple computers back in the 1980s, and collecting them at the same time, to the point where his collection has grown to over thousand items. And there’s also printers, monitors, and more.   Most of the Macs are in a warehouse where Borsky owes €20,000 to €30,000 ($23,000-35,000) in back rent. He’s hoping someone will take the collection in exchange for paying off what he owes.

 7 Painful Truths about the 2018 MacBook Pro 

Quit or canned? Why is Angela Ahrendts leaving Apple? [Opinion] When Apple fires an executive, the company is rarely straightforward about the situation. Apple never puts out a press release stating plainly that the executive was canned. So Tuesday’s unexpected announcement that Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s head of retail, is leaving in April led many to suspect she was fired. Most of the news stories about Ahrendts’ departure point out that it’s happening during the first-ever iPhone sales slump; The subtext is that she’s underperforming and has to go. Ryan Jones, an app developer with a popular Apple-centric Twitter feed, argues that Apple fired Ahrendts. His reasons: the timing of the announcement, coded language in the press release, and a claim that she was just four months from vesting stock. “Angela turned Apple Stores into a frustrating mess,” he wrote. “Service and buying are both slow and maddening.” No ‘gardening leave’ for Angela Ahrendts As noted by John Gruber, Vogue Business reporter Suzy Menke, who profiled Ahrendts just last week in a positive piece, quoted Ahrendts on Instagram saying the departing Apple leader misses her grown-up kids, who live in London. Ahrendts was based in the U.K. capital while CEO of Burberry and clearly misses the city The saga of Gil Amelio: the CEO that saved Apple Gil Amelio was Apple’s CEO for only 500 days, and in that time he rescued Apple from the brink of destruction. February 2, 1996: With disappointing Mac sales, the disastrous “clone Mac” strategy, and a failed Sun Microsystems merger to his name, Apple CEO Michael Spindler is asked to resign by the Apple board. Apple needs needs a miracle. In the last 4 years, they’ve lost over $230 million dollars. They turn to resurrection artist Gil Amelio, without whose leadership, Apple would probably not exist today.  Microsoft is bringing Xbox Live to Android and iOS Microsoft is gearing up to release a software development kit (SDK) that will allow Android and iOS developers to integrate Xbox Live features into their games. The SDK will be officially confirmed by Microsoft next month, will also be available to Nintendo Switch developers. Microsoft’s SDK comes after Epic Games broke boundaries with cross-platform play inside Fortnite. The battle royale behemoth is the first title that allows players on all systems — including Xbox, Switch, mobile, and now even PlayStation — to play together. It also allows users to log in to a single account and sync progress between different devices.","This week: The 2018 MacBook Pro is a beautiful machine, but it has some odd and painful flaws!

2019 - The year of HomeKit Until the release of iOS 11.3 in March, anyone who wanted to make HomeKit devices had to plan and pay to build in Apple’s authentication co-processor. With iOS 11.3, Apple changed the game, and allowed devices makers to add HomeKit with simple software integration. Apple promotes HomeKit at CES with press event to highlight new smart home accessories coming in 2019 Apple is pushing HomeKit hard at CES this year. It coordinated with manufacturers to demo key new HomeKit smart home announcements to the tech press TechCrunch says Apple spotlighted announcements from Belkin Wemo, Eve, ConnectSense, Kwikset locks, Nanoleaf lights, and a Netatmo HomeKit connected doorbell. We also got an announcement that Netgear is bringing HomeKit support to their Arlo Pro 2 cameras and their new 4K camera. And… a bunch of TVs  Here are all of the TVs getting AirPlay 2 in 2019 Apple announced that it will bring AirPlay 2 and HomeKit compatibility to a bunch of TVs in 2019, spanning models from manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Sony, and Vizio. A small list of 2018 models will also receive Airplay 2 support. Samsung TVs will be getting the iTunes Movies and TV apps. Sony will be adding HomeKit and AirPlay 2 to it beautiful TVs powered by the horrendous and slow Android TV.  Tim Cook: New services coming to Apple in 2019 Tim Cook teased new services that will be coming to Apple users this year. Responding to questions about falling iPhone sales during a CNBC interview, Cook stressed the way that Apple’s Services division has grown significantly in the past several years. “The services are on a tear,” Cook said. “On services, you will see us announce new services this year. There will more things coming.” First and foremost is Apple’s original TV content, which the company has supposedly spent more than $1 billion on, but not yet formally announced.

Largan’s sensors are capable of carrying out facial and iris recognition and provide an alternative to fingerprint scanning. They could be the solution Apple turns to if it is unable to embed a Touch ID scanner beneath the iPhone 8’s display. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models are already splash- and water-resistant with an IP67 rating, but Apple's fine print warns that ""splash, water, and dust resistance are not permanent conditions and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear."" iPhone water damage is not covered by Apple's warranties.  But in Wednesday's shareholders meeting, [Robert] Hwang, [Wistron CEO] told reporters that the Assembly process for the previous generations of [iPhones] have not changed much, though new features like waterproof and wireless charging now require some different testing, and waterproof function will alter the assembly process a bit,”  A report earlier this year said Apple's next iPhone models will feature improved IP68-rated water resistance (30 minutes in up to 3 feet of water)    2017 MacBook Pro is Up to 20% Faster Than Last Year's Model in Benchmarks  https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/07/2017-macbook-pro-benchmarks-geekbench/ Apple this week refreshed its MacBook Pro lineup with Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors, and early benchmarks for the notebooks suggest the 2017 models are up to 20 percent faster than the equivalent 2016 models equipped with Intel's sixth-generation Skylake processors.  Only about a 30% improvement over 2012/2013 MacBook Pros...    10.5-inch iPad Pro review roundup: Apple’s most impressive tablet yet  http://www.cultofmac.com/486616/10-5-inch-ipad-pro-review-roundup-apples-impressive-tablet-yet/ One of the big improvements of the new iPad Pro is its new variable refresh rate display, which Apple calls ProMotion, and means that it can run at 120Hz, or twice as fast as previous displays. It can also cycle down to 24Hz on still images. ARS has praised the new ProMotion by saying that it makes it easier to read text and scroll simultaneously, with the “ghosting” effect you get at 60Hz greatly reduced What everyone agrees on is that the new A10x processor is blazingly fast Smart keyboard is getting mixed reviews. Some saying it feels flimsy and unsatisfying to type on. Uses the newest Touch ID. Dramatically better antireflection coating.

On the show this week

 Apple reveals WWDC 2019 set for June 3 – 7 This morning, Apple revealed that it will host WWDC 2019 in San Jose, California, from June 3 to 7. Registered developers can apply for tickets now through March 20 at 5 p.m. Pacific on the WWDC website. Tickets cost $1,599 per person and are issued through a random selection process. iOS 13, macOS 10.15, watchOS 6 and tvOS 13 are all expected to be previewed during the WWDC 2019 keynote   

 It’s show time! Apple confirms March 25 event at Steve Jobs Theater Apple will hold its next special event on Monday, March 25, in the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino.   

 What to expect from Apple’s ‘show time’ event on March 25 The first Apple event of 2019 is nearly here. Tim Cook and friends are set to take the stage at the Steve Jobs Theater on March 25 to unveil the company’s newest goodies, only instead of unveiling some shiny new gadgets you can buy, Apple is supposedly going to bust out some services you can subscribe to. Apple’s “It’s show time” event is expected to be the first one ever where services and software play the starring roles. TV streaming service Instead of trying to be just like Netflix, Apple’s new TV service is expected to pull in content from other sources like Hulu, Showtime and HBO. As for Apple’s own TV shows, don’t expect them to be available at launch. The company allegedly will show a few previews at the event, giving us our first glimpse of the TV series it’s been working on. Some of the shows likely will come out later in the year, but Apple has so many projects in the works that most won’t come out until later. Apple News service Details about what, exactly, the new news service will look like remai murky. Rumors indicate it will cost about $9.99 per month, giving readers access to unlimited articles from sites that usually put their content behind a paywall. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and other publishers have all been approached to join the service. Some of those companies reportedly chafed at Apple’s proposed 50/50 revenue split Magazine Service Apple bought texture last year, a service that let users browse hundreds of magazine in digital format for $10 a month. Developer Steve Troughton-Smith has uncovered evidence of the new magazine service built in to the Apple News app. So we know that’s coming too.   

 Apple rushes to add HBO and Showtime to streaming service According to Bloombooger, Apple is hammering out the final details of agreements to add movies and TV shows from HBO, Showtime, Starz and others The negotiations allegedly would result in these shows appearing side-by-side with Apple’s own content, with the Showtime etc. getting a share of watchers’ subscription fees. Apparently 3rd party content is badly needed for the streaming app as Apple’s content is still in development and won’t be ready till the end of the year.   

 Apple News magazine service details revealed by latest macOS beta After digging into the latest macOS 10.14.4 beta, developer Steve Troughton-Smith found some new references that confirm the magazine subscription service is on the way. Even better, Apple’s code provides some new details about it that we didn’t know. Leander’s gotta talk about The Tim Cook Boo

This week's stories 

 Apple may be gearing up to replace controversial MacBook keyboard According to a new research note from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is set to replace them with a whole new keyboard switch mechanism. According to big Ming, this will debut with the 2019 MacBook Air (more on that in a second) This would be a return to the previous keyboard design, but with an Apple twist. Kuo says the switches in the new scissor keyboards will be made from glass-filled nylon, and material that is stronger than plastic, so it allows Apple to make the internal components stronger and thinner. This is the same material used in the switches of the 2015 butterfly keyboard mechanisms.  Latest MacBooks still use Apple’s flawed butterfly keyboard Big Ming got it wrong: Apple's newest MacBooks use the same 3rd-gen keybaord as the 2019 MacBook Pro, and are already included in the extended keyboard repair warranty. The new keyboard will likely debut in the 16"" MacBook Pro.  Apple brings True Tone to MacBook Air, faster chips to MacBook Pro Apple has updated the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro for the back-to-school season. And they’re now more affordable. The revised MacBook Air, now starts at $1,099 (down from $1,199) or $999 for college students, and has been updated with True Tone. The biggest improvements, however, are to the 13-inch MacBook Pro.  Apple officially ditches the 12-inch MacBook Apple has dropped the 12-inch MacBook after introducing an improved MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. The previous MacBook Air without a Retina display, which was Apple’s most affordable notebook, has also been ditched.","This week: Big Mac updates! But not like a Big Mac. We're talking computers.

This week's story links 

 macOS Catalina is out with new apps, Apple Arcade, Sidecar and more Apple’s big update for Macs, macOS Catalina, is finally out today bringing with it a host of new features, apps, privacy improvements, and much more. But if you have lots of Adobe plugins, or older apps that aren't 64-bit, you should hold off.  Apple’s first AR glasses could arrive in second quarter of 2020 Kuo reports in a note to investors, seen by MacRumors, that Apple’s first AR glasses will enter mass-production as soon as the fourth quarter of this year. They could arrive in early 2020. The device will be marketed as an iPhone accessory, and will rely on an Apple handset for computing, networking, and the sensors required for augmented reality.  Apple Prime? Giant bundle of entertainment services under consideration Currently, its biggest fans have to sign up separately for Apple Music ($9.99 a month), Apple TV+ ($4.99 a month), Apple News+ ($9.99 a month) and Apple Arcade ($4.99 a month). A bundle would allow people to get all of these as a single subscription — presumably at a lower cost. Apple is reportedly mulling offering all its entertainment services in one giant bundle as a sort of “Apple Prime.” If true, then a single subscription would include the company’s music, video, and gaming services It’s that last part that’s supposedly the sticking point with people in the music industry, according to Financial Times. These executives are concerned that reducing the amount subscribers pay would mean less money going to music producers.  Final Cut Pro X gets new Metal engine for big performance boost The latest version of Final Cut Pro X is out now with a new Metal engine that promises a big performance boost. It also make optimizations for the all-new Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR. Apple also brought the same Metal engine to Motion and Compressor, too. The new Metal engine in Final Cut Pro 10.4.7 improves playback and accelerates graphics tasks like rendering, real-time effects, and exporting on compatible machines. Apple says you will enjoy performance that is up to 20% faster on the newest 15-inch MacBook Pro, and 35% faster on the iMac Pro. And that’s not all you get in this update. Sidecar support lets you extend Final Cut Pro X onto an iPad in macOS Catalina. You can then use the second screen, connected wired or wirelessly, as the browser or viewer, Apple says. You can now also select which internal or external GPU is used to accelerate graphics processing.  Spotify update brings Siri support in iOS 13, new Apple TV app One of the many changes and new features in iOS 13 is a SiriKit API that lets third-party music streaming services take advantage of Apple’s virtual assistant for the first time. Well this week the Spotify update we’ve been waiting for since the launch of iOS 13 has landed. The latest version of the app finally adds Siri support, so you can ask the virtual assistant to play artists, tracks, and more. You can ask Siri to play artists, albums, tracks, and playlists after updating to the latest version of the app. Simply remember to add “with Spotify” to the end of your Siri requests.","This week: Apple’s AR glasses are about to be announced!

Thanks to shockingly strong iPhone sales and a surging wearables business that is bigger than the Mac and the iPad, Apple managed to surpass even the most optimistic expectations.  AirPods Pro supply problems couldn’t stop Apple’s surging wearables business When Apple reported an all-time record for quarterly revenue Tuesday, it got a big boost from one of its smallest products: the AirPods Pro.  Kuo: Huge 2020 lineup of new Apple products brings AirPower alternative A new report says major new hardware products are headed our way, including a 4.7-inch LCD iPhone, iPad Pro, MacBook Pro/Air, smaller wireless charging mat, UWB tag, and a high-end Bluetooth headphones.  DoubleTake is a video app that lets you shoot with 2 cameras A new iOS app lets users simultaneously record video using multiple iPhone cameras. DoubleTake is created by the makers of popular camera app Filmic Pro.  Buying MGM could prove crucial to Apple TV+ growth Apple is reportedly in talks to buy MGM, which would bring a catalogue of classic and modern movies to the iPhone maker’s streaming video service.","This week: A huge lineup of new Apple products is coming our way.

It uses an unlaminated screen, and is 7% heavier and 20% fatter than the iPad Air 2, but the screen is brighter. Goes on sale Friday March 24      iPad Mini The iPad mini 4 is still the same price, but you get more storage for free. The 128GB model with Wi-Fi now starts at $399, which was previously the price for the 32GB model.   iPad mini 4 gets 128GB of storage, still a total ripoff  http://www.cultofmac.com/472701/ipad-mini-4-gets-128gb-storage-still-total-ripoff/  It seems like a good deal. Until you consider that the new 9.7-inch iPad, which offers a bigger and sharper display and a faster A9 chip, makes it a total ripoff.     iPhone SE  The iPhone SE is still the same phone, but it’s now available in 32GB and 128GB flavors, doubling the storage capacity of the previous versions. Prices are still $399 and $499 (unlocked).     This is the (RED) iPhone 7 Apple should have made  http://www.cultofmac.com/472819/red-iphone-7-apple-made/  The company today unveiled a special edition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which will be available to order at 8:01 a.m. Pacific on Friday, March 24.\ They also cost the same as the regular iPhone 7s, but, there is no 32GB option. So, prices start at $749 for a 128GB iPhone 7, and $869 for a 128GB iPhone 7 Plus Not everyone loves the color…     Apple’s new Clips app muscles in on fun social video sharing http://www.cultofmac.com/472637/apple-clips-app/  Apple has announced the upcoming launch of a new app designed to make it fun and easy for people to create and share “expressive videos” on their iPhone and iPads.

The image is an iOS screenshot, and show shows the date of Tuesday, the 10. Aka, september 10.  Database exposes loads of incoming Apple products Multiple new MacBook, Apple Watch, iPod touch and iPhone models are coming this fall, according to a database that’s so far been very accurate about upcoming products. It belongs to the Eurasian Economic Commission, which become a gold mine for information on Apple computers that are right around the corner. The database lists 11 products that are described as “portable personal computers,” that run macOS Catalina. Four of these models are new, and the rest are updated versions of computers already registered with the Eurasian Economic Commission. The Eurasian Economic Commission lists twelve model numbers of wearables running watchOS 6. These are clearly the Apple Watch Series 5 devices that could launch next month. The EEC database also indicates we’ll receiving two new “media players” which run iOS 13, most likely meaning new iPod Touches. Two dozen smartphone models! In the past, devices have generally debuted a few months after appearing on this agency’s website, so all these newly-listed Apple computer models should be out well before the end of the year  2019 iPhone to bring tougher glass, even better Face ID We weren’t expecting much from the 2019 iPhone lineup. The rumors led us to believe they would be very similar to existing models, but with faster chips and improved cameras. But Reliable Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman today reveals that we can also look forward to a more robust design for high-end models that uses unspecified “shatter-resistance technology.”  Accessory makers are already preparing cases for Apple’s next-generation iPhone lineup, including an “iPhone 11 Pro” that will support a brand new Apple Pencil. We’ve heard whispers of Apple Pencil support for the iPhone 11. One analyst promised the upgrade back in July. But this is the first time we’ve seen what might be considered real evidence.

 What went wrong with Apple’s doomed AirPower charging mat? AirPower is officially dead. It’s the first time in Apple’s history that they canceled an announced, but unreleased product. It’s been about 1.5 years since Apple titillated fans by revealing a wireless charging mat that supposedly would charge not one, not two, but three Apple devices at the same time. Overheating problems reportedly posed the biggest hurdle for bringing AirPower to market. We heard rumors and rumblings for more than a year that Apple faced serious technical hurdles as it tried to make AirPower a reality. Most wireless charging mats have only one power-generating coil. Some specialized chargers offer two coils, placed far apart. Apple tried to put three or more charging coils into one pad so you could place your device anywhere and it would start charging. One of John Gruber’s sources said the design would never work; it violated the laws of physics. But here’s the real AirPower problem no one’s talking about… Two-way charging and bigger batteries rumored for 2019 iPhones According to a new report from Mind Chi Kuo, Apple is reportedly planning to add two-way charging that will allow it to recharge your Apple Watch, AirPods and even other iPhones. Now if this feature sounds familiar, it may be because Samsung included on the Galaxy S10+... Kuo also claims battery capacity will increase between 10 percent and 25 percent on the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max successors. The iPhone XS successor will get the biggest gains, while the iPhone XR successor is expected to get minimal battery gains Other rumored features for the 2019 iPhone lineup includes a three-lens camera on the back, improved Face ID sensors, a more powerful A13 processor and possibly support for Apple Pencil  The MacBook keyboard fiasco is way worse than Apple thinks David Heinemeier Hansson. Founder of Basecamp. Creator of Ruby on Rails. Apple keep insisting that only a “small number of customers have problems” with the MacBook keyboards. That’s bollocks. This is a huge issue, it’s getting worse not better, and Apple is missing the forest for the trees. So here’s some anecdata for Apple. I sampled the people at Basecamp. Out of the 47 people using MacBooks at the company, a staggering 30% are dealing with keyboard issues right now!! And that’s just the people dealing with current keyboard issues. If you include all the people who used to have issues, but went through a repair or replacement process, the number would be even higher. Worth noting here is that the 3rd generation membrane keyboard did nothing to fix the issues. Six out of thirteen – nearly half!! – of the 2018+ MacBooks we have at the company have a failed keyboard. He did a Twitter poll that currently has over 7300 responses.  37% have no keyboard issues. 11% had issues that were fixed by Apple 52% have issues now that they’re just living with. He’s calling for Apple to do a Total Recall….","This week: AirPower—the real problem no one else is talking about… Plus: 2019 iPhone rumors point to some wildly useful new features; more evidence the 2018 MacBook, Air and Pro keyboards are STILL having issues.

The company made it clear that the new Mac Pro is in the works, but they also gave a spec bump to the current line. It is possible we may see an announcement about the pro-level iMacs they talked about, especially considering it hasn’t been updated since Oct. 2015!  Maybe we’ll get some Kaby lake chips.    10.5-inch iPad Pro KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks there’s a good chance Apple will debut its 10.5-inch iPad Pro at this year’s event. But if it will be using a new design language similar to the iPhone 8, it probably won’t be revealed until after the new iPhones.    Apple is already manufacturing its Siri-powered speaker  http://www.cultofmac.com/484166/apple-already-manufacturing-siri-powered-speaker/#more-484166 Apple’s grand unveiling of its Siri-powered home speaker could come as soon as next week, according to a new report that claims production on the new device is already underway. “The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup,” reports Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. If Apple does announce the speaker at WWDC don’t expect it to be available immediately. The report claims that units won’t ship until later this year, giving devs plenty of time to integrate their applications with it.    Apple registers new Macs, iPads, Magic Keyboard ahead of WWDC  http://www.cultofmac.com/484076/apple-registers-new-macs-ipads-magic-keyboard-ahead-wwdc/ Apple has registered a bunch of new products with the Eurasian Economic Commission ahead of WWDC next week. Its filings hint at the imminent arrival of new Macs, iPads, and a refreshed Magic Keyboard.

 Pre-Order Leander's new book, signed! 

9 months with stereo HomePods! The good, bad, & the UGLY! 

Apple cuts price of HomePod in U.S. and other countries Apple permanently slashed the price of HomePod in the United States and a number of other countries. The company’s first smart speaker now lists for $299 — a full $50 less than its original price. Some might assume the HomePod discount is a result of lackluster sales. But Apple says it is simply passing on savings achieved by manufacturing at scale, according to AppleInsider. (It’s a shame the company doesn’t do that with all its products.)  Biggest MacBook in years could debut in 2021 Ming Chi Kuo says Apple is working on a MacBook Pro that’s bigger than any released in years. The downside is this model won’t be out until 2021. This device, as well as a new iPad and an external display, will all supposedly use a new type of display: microLED.microLED is the next generation of screen technology. It’s brings the strength the strengths of OLED, perfect black levels, incredible color saturation and accuracy, without the negatives, E.G. degrading performance and brightness over time, and burn in. Multiple companies are currently working to figure out how to manufacture the technology, but it’s hard, because the LEDS have to be perfectly placed or the screen brightness looks wonky. The MacBook that will be between 15 and 17 inched. but he’s now saying this will be out in the first half of 2021. This is the same machine Kuo implied would be a major redesign...  Apple’s beloved MagSafe connector could make a comeback Apple is exploring charging cables that attach to its devices with magnets. Apple just received a patent for “Smart Charging Systems for Portable Electronic Devices.” This describes using magnets in cables to prevent damage if they get yanked on. Apple envisions the system taking an active part in disconnecting itself if an accident occurs. “The connector can be disconnected from the portable electronic device by the charging component before the jolting event occurs.” MagSafe was only for MacBooks, but the new version might have a much wider reach. The patent says this magnetized charging system could be used with “a smart phone, wearable device, smart watch, tablet, personal computer, and the like.” That said, this is only a patent application, not a product announcement. It’s possible this research might not ever become a product.  Inside Apple’s factories [Cook book outtakes] Apple’s capital expenditure, or CapEx, is mindboggling. To get an idea of how big it is, take Apple’s new spaceship campus in Cupertino – which is the fourth most expensive building in the world. It cost the company an estimated $5 billion to construct. Apple spends a similar amount every six months on manufacturing equipment",This week: Apple’s readying a totally redesigned MacBook Pro with next gen display! We discuss.

The embargo lifted Tuesday morning, and the early reviews reveal a few surprising tidbits about the HomePod.   HomePod sound quality is amazing  <ul> <li>TechCrunch: “Apple’s HomePod is easily the best sounding mainstream smart speaker ever. It’s got better separation and bass response than anything else in its size and boasts a nuance and subtlety of sound that pays off the 7 years Apple has been working on it.”</li> </ul>    HomePod sounds better than expensive speakers  <ul> <li>WSJ: “The HomePod sounds noticeably richer and fuller than almost every other speaker we’ve testedApple’s audio engineering team did something really clever and new with the HomePod, and it really works. I’m not sure there’s anything out there that sounds better for the price, or even several times the price.</li> </ul>    HomePod sucks at music recommendations  <ul> <li>Apple frames the ability to tell Siri to play your favorite music, and immediately hear soothing tones blasted out of the speaker, as one of the HomePod’s main draws. Cupertino promises that Siri will learn your musical tastes over time, but based on The New York Times’ review, that’s not what actually happens.</li> </ul>    HomePod only syncs with one iCloud account  <ul> <li>That sucks if you don’t live alone.</li> </ul>    Not a very good assistant  <ul> <li>Siri is limited and doesn’t compete with Alexa or Google intelligence.</li> <li> <ul> <li>TechCrunch: Siri doesn’t do a lot of “other” stuff that isn’t about audio content. Apple says this is because the vast majority of people use these speakers for basic commands like playing music and setting timers.

The embargo lifted Tuesday morning, and the early reviews reveal a few surprising tidbits about the HomePod.   HomePod sound quality is amazing  TechCrunch: “Apple’s HomePod is easily the best sounding mainstream smart speaker ever. It’s got better separation and bass response than anything else in its size and boasts a nuance and subtlety of sound that pays off the 7 years Apple has been working on it.”     HomePod sounds better than expensive speakers  WSJ: “The HomePod sounds noticeably richer and fuller than almost every other speaker we’ve testedApple’s audio engineering team did something really clever and new with the HomePod, and it really works. I’m not sure there’s anything out there that sounds better for the price, or even several times the price.     HomePod sucks at music recommendations  Apple frames the ability to tell Siri to play your favorite music, and immediately hear soothing tones blasted out of the speaker, as one of the HomePod’s main draws. Cupertino promises that Siri will learn your musical tastes over time, but based on The New York Times’ review, that’s not what actually happens.     HomePod only syncs with one iCloud account  That sucks if you don’t live alone.     Not a very good assistant  Siri is limited and doesn’t compete with Alexa or Google intelligence.  TechCrunch: Siri doesn’t do a lot of “other” stuff that isn’t about audio content. Apple says this is because the vast majority of people use these speakers for basic commands like playing music and setting timers. But it does offer best-in-class voice recognition, vastly outstripping the ability of other smart speakers to hear you trying to trigger a command at a distance or while music is playing, but its overall flexibility is stymied by the limited command sets that the Siri protocol offers.  Siri can’t even set more than one timer Siri can’t recognize multiple voices (someone could ask it to read your texts, or even send an iMessage)     You can use Spotify via AirPlay, but you can’t control it with your voice   The smarts are in the music tech  When plugged in, HomePod goes through a series of aural exercises you first plug it in to determine how best to structure its sound. It also includes an accelerometer, so if you move the speaker, it will retune itself. Eddie Cue revealed recently that HomePod will adjust how it sounds to each song you play based on Apple’s analytics.     Redheads and superheroes included in 150+ new emojis for 2018  https://www.cultofmac.com/527963/red-heads-superheroes-included-150-new-emoji-2018/  The Unicode Consortium has approved more than 150 new emoji characters that will likely be headed to iOS and macOS later this year. The Unicode Consortium has approved more than 150 new emoji characters that will likely be headed to iOS and macOS later this year.     Apple hiring spree means something big is on the way  https://www.cultofmac.com/527819/apple-hiring-spree-means-something-big-way/  Apple has been busy hiring a record number of engineers over the last few months. The move comes after the company also went on a designer hiring spree, indicating a major new product or two could be in the works. Job openings for engineering jobs at Apple rose 80% from the period starting in September until just last week. The company’s listings went from 665 open hardware engineering positions to 1,198 last week. What exactly Apple is working on is anyone’s best guess right now, but check out these job listings:  Analog Layout Designer, Advanced Material Scientist (Electrolyte Development), 3D Perception/Computer Vision Algorithm Engineer, Sensor Design Engineer, Motion Sensing Hardware Engineer: Magnetics, and even a Flexible Display Technologist.

Now we have an idea what it might look like and when it could be revealed. Apple's Siri-based smart speaker and home hub has an ""over 50 percent chance"" of being announced at WWDC, according to our homeboy Ming Chi Kuo. Kuo said Apple's smart home product will likely launch in the second half of 2017 and cost more than the Amazon Echo, $179. The device will supposedly support AirPlay with ""excellent acoustics performance"" from one woofer and seven tweeters. Kuo said its performance will be similar to the iPhone 6/6s. Last week, leaker Sonny Dickson likewise said Apple's smart speaker could be announced as early as WWDC. He said the device will run a variation of iOS with unspecified Beats technology, in addition to a Mac Pro-like concave top with built-in controls and speaker meshing covering the majority of its surface. A report from The Information said Apple's smart home speaker would be able to control appliances, locks, lights, and curtains through Siri voice commands.

 Apple’s wearables is now the size of a Fortune 200 company Sales of the Apple Watch grew 50% compared to the same quarter last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Apple’s Q2 2019 quarterly analyst call on Tuesday. If Apple’s wearables business — which includes the Apple Watch and the popular AirPod earbuds — were a stand-alone company, it would be in the Fortune 200, Cook said. Apple’s wearables business also includes its home and accessories category. Together, sales in the March quarter hit a record $5.1 billion in revenue, up from $3.94 billion in the year-ago quarter. Wearables now almost as big as the Mac business (5.5B last quarter). Services business is now more than twice as big as the Mac business!  Apple Shipped an Estimated 36.4 Million iPhones Worldwide in Q1 2019, a 30% Year-Over-Year Decline Apple shipped an estimated 36.4 million iPhones worldwide during the first calendar quarter of 2019, which corresponds to Apple's second fiscal quarter, according to new estimates shared today by IDC.

Ireland’s finance ministry has sided with Apple, and said it “disagrees profoundly” with the decision. The European Commission's issue is really not with Apple but with Ireland. The commission is not a tax authority; instead, its job is to maintain fairness between the EU member states. Countries are able to set their own tax rates, but country can’t offer something special that's seen as benefiting an individual company. In 1991,  Ireland (who’s economy was struggling) signed off on a plan in which Apple would move money to a stateless ""head office”. ""Apple entered into a deal with Ireland to not pay tax on all those profits,” and Apple paid ""an arbitrarily small amount to Ireland in return for a promise to keep jobs in Ireland.” (The kept 6000 there.) Low corporate tax was one way Ireland improved its economy and attracted big companies, and Apple was one of the early companies to benefit.","This week: what new hardware will Apple bestow upon us at the iPhone 7 event next week?  Don’t miss our predictions!  Plus: new video shows iPhone 7 Plus in the wild;  and we explain Apple’s Irish tax woes, then argue about it....",,e064355fa59e099fcde81b16f9b36d28,2D896BCB-E4E8-4EC2-B80F-2248D5A5CB95,CultCast #247 - Kahney’s Shady Banana Tree Holdings INC,public.audio,1BB5F91F-09CF-4F6F-BC50-876F5741B8AA,http://thecultcast.libsyn.com/cultcast-247-kahneys-shady-banana-tree-holdings-inc,,

year’s numbers</a> to the killer iPhone 6 sales that drove

<li>Apple’s tablets are doing fine, really, selling 10.3 million
units this quarter. But in general, tablets are stinking up the

In a nutshell, that it’s futuristic, but maybe not an entirely successful device for present-day users. <ul> <li>Wired: The new MacBook Pro is a terrific laptop and, like the super-skinny MacBook, a clear indication of where most of the computing world is going. But comes with growing pains</li> <li>Techcrunch: The less celebrated spec bumps are what make the new Pro a worthy upgrade. Better processors, more storage, a brighter display and better speakers are all wrapped up in a sleeker and lighter package than before… The Touch Bar feels like a nice bonus for the time being.</li> <li><em><a href= ""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2016/11/the-2016-13-and-15-inch-touch-bar-macbook-pros-reviewed/""> ArsTechnica</a></em><a href= ""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2016/11/the-2016-13-and-15-inch-touch-bar-macbook-pros-reviewed/"">‘s Andrew Cunningham</a> writes, “The more I use the Touch Bar, the more I become convinced of its potential utility” — although a lot of its ability to replace the old function buttons remains hypothetical for now.”</li> <li> <ul> <li>Industry-leading storage performance.</li> <li>Touchbar get 1.3Gbps WiFI (like 2015 model) instead of 867Mbps.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href= ""http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/14/13618142/walt-mossberg-macbook-pro-fast-slim-tweener""> Walt Mossberg</a> describes the Touch Bar as having “potential, but it’s not magic.”</li> <li>ARS: CPU performance increases by an amount that’s roughly proportionate to the 200MHz maximum clock speed increase, and GPU performance increases by around 10 percent. It’s not nothing...</li> <li>WSJ:  “it’s a dongle nightmare.” The SD card slot is particularly missed.</li> <li>WSJ: A Touch Bar, Touch ID and new design are tempting, but you’ll get the same performance and battery with the older model… So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out.</li> </ul>   MacBook Pro Touch Bar lets users skip through YouTube ads <a href= ""http://www.cultofmac.com/454274/macbook-pro-youtube/"">http://www.cultofmac.com/454274/macbook-pro-youtube/</a> <ul> <li>First spotted by users on Reddit, at present the fancy new Touch Bar lets users scrub through otherwise unskippable ads so you can start watching videos straight away.</li> <li>“In Safari, the touchbar [sic] will pop up a scrubbing control whenever a video begins to play,” Redditor RomansFiveEight writes. “Amazingly, you can use that to scrub THROUGH an ad, even a non-skippable 30 second pre-roll ad; and begin your video right away!”</li> </ul>   Apple chronicles 20 years of iconic design in pricey new book <a href= ""http://www.cultofmac.com/454027/apple-chronicles-20-years-iconic-design-pricey-new-book/""> http://www.cultofmac.com/454027/apple-chronicles-20-years-iconic-design-pricey-new-book/</a> <ul> <li>Apple has announced that it will be debuting a new hardbound book, entitled “Designed by Apple in California,” chronicling 20 years of its groundbreaking designs — boasting 450 photographs of past and present Apple products.</li> <li>The book, which is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs, will also include exclusive details on the design processes used by Apple’s design team under the leadership of Jony Ive.</li> <li>The photos contained are all shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman, a filmmaker and photographer who has previously shot portraits of Judi Dench, Clint Eastwood, Ted Kennedy, and others.</li> <li>“Designed by Apple in California”</li> <li>it is available in two sizes — including a small 10.20” x 12.75” edition for $199 and a large version sized at 13” x 16.25” — costing $299.</li> <li>Specially milled German paper</li> <li>Gilded matte silver edges</li> <li>Low-ghost inks</li> </ul>   Jony Ive goes inside Apple’s design lab in new video <a href= ""http://www.cultofmac.com/454084/jony-ive-goes-inside-apples-design-lab-new-video/""> http://www.cultofmac.com/454084/jony-ive-goes-inside-apples-design-lab-new-video/</a> <ul> <li>Going inside Apple’s design lab is a rare privilege some Apple execs don’t even get, but Jony Ive is giving the world a glimpse inside his lab to celebrate the company’s new book.</li> </ul>   Apple had to buy back old products featured in its new design book <a href= ""http://www.cultofmac.com/454045/apple-buy-back-products/""> http://www.cultofmac.com/454045/apple-buy-back-products/</a> <ul> <li>According to a new interview with Jony Ive, Apple had to actually go out and buy copies of its old products in order to photograph them for its new <a href= ""https://www.cultofmac.com/454027/apple-chronicles-20-years-iconic-design-pricey-new-book/"">$300 coffee table book</a></li> <li>“[W]e’ve been so consumed by our current and future work we came to realise we didn’t have a catalogue of the physical products,” Ive told design journal <em>Wallpaper*</em>. ” … Many of the products that you see, we actually had to go out and purchase. It’s a rather shameful admission, but it’s just not an area that we really invested much time or energy in.”</li> <li>Shortly after he returned to the company in the late 1990s, Steve Jobs gave Apple’s historical archive — comprising records that management at Apple had kept since the mid-1980s — to Stanford University Libraries because he didn’t want Apple to be fixated on the past.</li> <li>A few years after that, in 1996, an ex-Apple employee named David Pakman who had worked there from 1991 through 1997 emailed Steve to suggest staging a celebratory event for Apple’s thirtieth birthday. He received a simple answer: Apple is focused on the future, not the past. —Steve</li> <li>Fortunately, things are changing, Ive said.

In a nutshell, that it’s futuristic, but maybe not an entirely successful device for present-day users. Wired: The new MacBook Pro is a terrific laptop and, like the super-skinny MacBook, a clear indication of where most of the computing world is going. But comes with growing pains Techcrunch: The less celebrated spec bumps are what make the new Pro a worthy upgrade. Better processors, more storage, a brighter display and better speakers are all wrapped up in a sleeker and lighter package than before… The Touch Bar feels like a nice bonus for the time being.  ArsTechnica‘s Andrew Cunningham writes, “The more I use the Touch Bar, the more I become convinced of its potential utility” — although a lot of its ability to replace the old function buttons remains hypothetical for now.”  Industry-leading storage performance. Touchbar get 1.3Gbps WiFI (like 2015 model) instead of 867Mbps.   Walt Mossberg describes the Touch Bar as having “potential, but it’s not magic.” ARS: CPU performance increases by an amount that’s roughly proportionate to the 200MHz maximum clock speed increase, and GPU performance increases by around 10 percent. It’s not nothing... WSJ:  “it’s a dongle nightmare.” The SD card slot is particularly missed. WSJ: A Touch Bar, Touch ID and new design are tempting, but you’ll get the same performance and battery with the older model… So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out.    MacBook Pro Touch Bar lets users skip through YouTube ads http://www.cultofmac.com/454274/macbook-pro-youtube/ First spotted by users on Reddit, at present the fancy new Touch Bar lets users scrub through otherwise unskippable ads so you can start watching videos straight away. “In Safari, the touchbar [sic] will pop up a scrubbing control whenever a video begins to play,” Redditor RomansFiveEight writes. “Amazingly, you can use that to scrub THROUGH an ad, even a non-skippable 30 second pre-roll ad; and begin your video right away!”    Apple chronicles 20 years of iconic design in pricey new book  http://www.cultofmac.com/454027/apple-chronicles-20-years-iconic-design-pricey-new-book/ Apple has announced that it will be debuting a new hardbound book, entitled “Designed by Apple in California,” chronicling 20 years of its groundbreaking designs — boasting 450 photographs of past and present Apple products. The book, which is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs, will also include exclusive details on the design processes used by Apple’s design team under the leadership of Jony Ive. The photos contained are all shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman, a filmmaker and photographer who has previously shot portraits of Judi Dench, Clint Eastwood, Ted Kennedy, and others. “Designed by Apple in California” it is available in two sizes — including a small 10.20” x 12.75” edition for $199 and a large version sized at 13” x 16.25” — costing $299.

It’s a rather shameful admission, but it’s just not an area that we really invested much time or energy in.” Shortly after he returned to the company in the late 1990s, Steve Jobs gave Apple’s historical archive — comprising records that management at Apple had kept since the mid-1980s — to Stanford University Libraries because he didn’t want Apple to be fixated on the past. A few years after that, in 1996, an ex-Apple employee named David Pakman who had worked there from 1991 through 1997 emailed Steve to suggest staging a celebratory event for Apple’s thirtieth birthday. He received a simple answer: Apple is focused on the future, not the past. —Steve Fortunately, things are changing, Ive said. Around eight years ago, the company felt an “obligation” to go out and start building up an archive of every product it had released.    Liveblog: The best Black Friday deals for 2016  http://www.cultofmac.com/453858/liveblog-best-black-friday-deals-2016/   Mavic Pro—10 years ago you’d need a helicopter to get footage like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i9Uo_szlqU",This week: the reviews are in!

Erfon has a moment of eros reviewing Logitech's most premium keyboard 

 Apple apologizes for continuing problems with MacBook keyboard MacBooks made after 2015 have had keyboard issues. Apple tweaked the design of this critical component last year, and there was great optimism that the problem had been fixed in the latest macOS computers. Nope. After months of use, owners of the 2018 MacBook Pro or MacBook Air are reporting keys that stick, either so they become unresponsive or repeat letters. This was highlighted today by Joanna Stern in a Wall Street Journal editorial written on a MacBook Pro with the E and R keys failing. “To sha th pain of using an Appl laptop kyboad that’s faild aft fou months, I could only think of on ida: tak all th bokn ltts out of my column,” wrote Stern. The WSJ article has toggles to make the missing letters reappear. Apple responded to Stern’s article by saying “We are aware that a small number of users are having issues with their third-generation butterfly keyboard and for that we are sorry.

  Tim Cook: Pro users remain incredibly important to Apple  http://www.cultofmac.com/469839/apple-investors-vote-against-diversity-at-annual-shareholders-meeting/  During his Q&A session, Tim Cook discussed how Apple plans to fight for net neutrality. He also assured shareholders that Apple plans to come out with new products that appeal to professionals and creatives, but insisted that the Mac and iPad aren’t destined for a merger. “You will see us do more in the pro area. The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular,” Cook told the crowd. “You can expect to see us do more and more that people will view iPad as a laptop replacement, but not a Mac replacement.

Marzipan is set to be unveiled for the Mac, meaning developers can bring their iPad apps to the Mac. This should be interesting. Apple will be bringing the Podcast app to the Mac, along with Find my Friends, Find my iPhone, and Screen Time. New voice memos app so you can record notes from your wrist. New watch faces (from Bloomberg: A “Gradient” face that makes a gradient look out of a color the user chooses, at least two new “X-Large” faces that show jumbo numbers in different fonts and colors, a “California” dial that looks like a classic watch face and mixes Roman numerals with Arabic numerals, a redesigned “Solar Analog” watch face that looks like a sundial, and a new “Infograph Subdial” one that includes larger complication views like a stock market chart or the weather. Apple is also adding more complications Hardware There’s a chance we could see new hardware, like the new Mac Pro, or Bloomberg says there’s a possibility we’ll see a new Apple Display featuring HDR.

They also promise powerful graphics, a T2 Security Chip, super-fast SSDs, and “all-day” battery life. Apple also addressed problems with the Butterly keyboard, noting that these new models use different materials in the keyboards which will supposedly reduce the well-publicized issues with keys sticking. According to Apple:  You’ll get to enjoy up to twice as many Alchemy plugins in Logic Pro X. You’ll render 3D scenes up to twice as fast in Maya Arnold. You’ll get to apply complex edits and filters up to 75% faster in Photoshop. And you’ll compile code up to 65% faster in Xcode.

 WSJ: High-end ‘iPhone 11’ will feature triple rear camera, XR successor gets dual lenses The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Apple’s iPhone 2019 lineup will feature three models, including 2 OLED and 1 LCD. They’re basically just upgrading the XS, Tennis Match, and XR. But get this, the high-end iPhone 11, probably called the iPhone 11 Max, will feature a triple rear camera system. Triple! The iPhone 5.8-inch iPhone 11 will stick with a dual lens system. The successor to the iPhone XR will have an LCD screen panel, and will be upgraded to a dual-camera system. The report says that Apple may drop the LCD option in 2020, moving to an OLED only lineup late next year. It also alludes to the removal of the pressure sensitive component that enables 3D Touch, in order to reduce components costs. It doesn’t say that 3D Touch is certainly going away necessarily as the feature may be achieved through other hardware changes. Apple unleashes new Smart Battery Cases for iPhone XS, XS Max and XR Apple’s new Smart Battery Cases are now available iPhone XS, XS Max and XR Along with adding some extra protection to your device, Apple’s new cases promise to deliver 37 hours more hours of talk time, Internet use up to 20 hours The cases also support wireless charging. Only cost a mere $129! And it seems that the XS case will work with the iPhone X, but it does block some of the mics and speakers since it’s not made to fit the X Nike kills shoelaces with new iPhone-controlled sneakers The back to the future shoes you’ve always wanted are finally a reality. Nike’s new Adapt BB self-lacing shoes pack wireless connectivity, and a custom motor and gear train, to give athletes a perfect fit without having to fuss with retying their laces. The Adapt BB shoes can be tightened and loosened using the buttons on the side of the shoe or via an app (both iOS and Android). This could be really valuable to basketball players, whose feet can expand half a size during the rigors of a game. Getting a taste of the future won’t come cheap. Nike will charge $350 for a pair of Adapt BBs when they launch next month. Netflix hikes prices for U.S. subscribers Netflix has confirmed another price hike for subscribers in the United States — its biggest increase since it launched 12 years ago. The most affordable Netflix plan, which was priced at $8 a month, now costs $9 a month. The most popular plan has risen from $11 a month to $13 a month. The premium plan that offers 4K content is has gone from $14 a month to $16 a month. The new prices will be applied to new Netflix subscribers immediately, while existing customers will see the increase during the next three months It costs a lost of money to make that content. Netflix spent a staggering $3 billion last year, and expects to do so again in 2019. In an effort to cut down on its borrowing, it will charge more for its service. Our Under Review Picks 

Tik Tok is the wild west of social media 

They’re making a sequel to last year’s Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle reboot Variety reports that Danny Glover is joining the cast of the Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle sequel in a role that is being kept under wraps, much like the still-secret storyline. Charcutería: The Soul of Spain This news is on the heels that Danny Devito is onboard The original cast, director, and script writers are also all on board  They’re making Ghostbusters 3. It will continue the story from Ghostbuster’s 2 The movie will be directed by Jason Reitman, who is the filmmaker son of Ivan Reitman, who directed and produced the original 1984 comedic hit ""Ghostbusters"" with Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. In an interview with EW.com, Reitman said he would divert from director Paul Feig's 2016 reboot of ""Ghostbusters"" that featured an all-women cast that included Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones. Reitman will go back to the original universe his father created in the present day story. The movie is expected to release in 2020, and we don’t yet know if any of the original cast will be involved. Charcutería: The Soul of Spain

 Hollywood stars tapped to attend Apple’s March event Some of the biggest names in Hollywood are coming to Silicon Valley for Apple’s first big event of 2019. Apple is rumored to be planning a late March keynote where a slew of new services will be unveiled. To help with its pitch to customers, Apple has asked some of the stars from its original TV shows to join the festivities. Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Garner and director JJ Abrams have reportedly been invited by Apple to attend its March 25 event. All four of them have at least one project in development at Apple. Witherspoon’s production company actually had two shows picked up by the company. Apple’s TV streaming service will reportedly offer original content for free. There are dozens of shows in various stages of development right now. The service will also sell subscriptions to other channels like Starz, Showtime and maybe even HBO. Initially all of Apple’s content will be free, but they plan to launch a paid tier of content by this summer. The March event will also see Apple unveil its news subscription service too. Publishers are reportedly still negotiating revenue split deals for that service. Apple was allegedly asking for a 50/50 split on revenues. Customers would pay $10 per month for unlimited access to articles from some of the biggest names in news. With the event more than a month away there are still tons of details that could change.  AirPods are Apple’s second-fastest selling new product of all time Apple’s AirPods are the company’s second best-selling new product of all time, a new report by Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart suggests. Cybart estimates that Apple is on track to sell 40 million pairs of AirPods in 2019. That represents almost 90 percent year-over-year growth. “There are already at least 25 million people wearing AirPods. This total will likely exceed 50 million people later this year. These are massive sales and adoption figures for a two-year old product that has never received an update and rarely goes on sale for less than its $159 selling price.” The most popular Apple product out of the gate?","This week: it's all but confirmed--Apple's holding a March media event to make some special announcements. We'll tell you what we know. Plus: Apple's all-time best-selling products may surprise you; and is it worth buying a 2018 MacBook Pro, or should...",,000b26bc6793a9e81c6a2e8691fdeb3b,2D896BCB-E4E8-4EC2-B80F-2248D5A5CB95,"CultCast #375 - March Apple Event, incoming!",public.audio,D78E686E-CD84-4B27-A5CD-3008511C7EBF,http://thecultcast.libsyn.com/cultcast-375-march-apple-event-incoming,,

The entrance to the venue sits underneath a silver disc, which which sits 20 feet in the air, supported by gigantic glass panels. The auditorium itself occupies four underground stories, and to get there, journalists will descend a staircase spiraling down alongside the walls. In order to gain access to the subterranean theater, attendees can either descend via a spiral staircase or using two custom elevators. These elevators rotate as they descend, so that passengers enter and exit through the same door, even though they do so from different directions. The theater also sports a retracting wall, which opens to reveal a hidden product testing area. Given the theater's 1,000-person capacity, one engineer said back in March that the building's budget meant each leather seat had cost Apple the equivalent of $14,000 apiece. It’s a touching eponym, isn’t it?  Steve Jobs theater?  It will be a beautiful spectacle of technology and architecture, a true and fitting monument.  A metaphor for Steve Jobs, and a physical representation of the Apple ethos. Steve Jobs was man that literally started with nothing, not even his biological parents, and went on to build one of the world’s most coveted companies. It’s a uniquely American success story.      Analyst: Blame Samsung for iPhone 8’s high price tag  https://www.cultofmac.com/500884/analyst-samsung-partly-blame-iphone-8s-high-price-tag/ Apple’s upcoming premium iPhone is likely to be its most expensive model ever — and Samsung is partly to blame, according to a reliable Apple analyst. In his latest research note, KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo explains to investors that Samsung currently holds a practical monopoly on the supply of OLED displays. They’re the only ones capable of reliably mass producing the screens Apple needs, and thus seems to be inflating the price. Apple previously paid between $45 and $55 for the screens on Plus-size iPhones. But Ming Chi Kuo claims Samsung is probably charging about $75 more for OLED displays. The final price for the displays likely costs Apple $120 to $130 per unit.

 Here’s what Apple’s (apparently) got in store for 2019 Ming-Chi Kuo’s new research report runs down some of his hardware expectations for the coming year, and my nips have been at 105% of capacity since reading it. We’re talking redesigned MacBook Pro, iPads, a new Apple cinema display, AirPods, even a new iPOD... this could be a year to remember. Kuo predicts 2019 will see the release of Apple’s biggest MacBook since 2012. The new MacBook Pro will boast a screen between 16 inches and 16.5 inches in size. This would be the largest MacBook notebook screen since the end of the 17-inch models seven years ago. It will be a total redesign! Kuo says the 13” will possibly get an option for 32GB of RAM. Dave Lee theory - the new design will have to address thermal issues. Current MBP design is too thin for modern chips. It can’t keep them cool, like with the current i9 throttling. Now intel has a new 9th-gen 8 core chip, and there’s no way the current design could handle it.  Apple Said to Release 31.6-Inch 6K Display With Mini LED-Like Backlight Design in 2019 Apple will release a 31.6-inch 6K display with a Mini LED-like backlight design in 2019, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo Apple left the display market back in 2016 with the discontinuation of the outdated Thunderbolt Display. Apple did, however, say they were working on a new screen alongside the new Mac Pro  AirPower and New AirPods Said to Ship in First Half of 2019, New iPod Touch With Faster Processor Also Expected Apple's long-awaited AirPower wireless charging mat and a new version of AirPods with wireless charging support and upgraded Bluetooth connectivity will start shipping in the first half of 2019, Kuo also expects a new iPod touch with a faster processor to launch in 2019.  Two New iPad Pro Models, 10.2-Inch iPad, and iPad Mini 5 Said to Launch in 2019 According to Kuo, Apple plans to release two new iPad Pro models, a 10.2-inch iPad, and a refreshed iPad mini, each equipped with an upgraded processor, later this year. The 9.7-inch iPad is getting upgraded to 10.2 inches. No news on if it’s going full screen with FaceID.  Don’t expect a major redesign for this year’s iPad mini 5 The iPad mini hasn’t gotten a sequel since 2015. However, if you’re expecting this year’s rumored refresh to be a massive leap forward, you might want to think again. At least, that’s based on an alleged CAD render shared by noted leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer, a.k.a. @OnLeaks. While he hasn’t shared the image, he suggests that there are no external major design changes — and only a spec bump update.  Apple may finally give fans a first look at its revamped Mac Pro at WWDC 2019 Apple may finally give fans a first look at its revamped Mac Pro at WWDC 2019. Bloomberg is reporting that Apple has “internally weighed” the possibility of previewing the new Mac Pro alongside updates to macOS and iOS at this year’s WWDC, which is expected to take place between June 3 and June 7 in San Jose. Apple has also put together a ""Pro Workflow Team"" to tailor the Mac Pro and other Apple products to its professional users. The timing seems right. Speaking about the Mac Pro in 2017, Phil Schiller said this:  With regards to the Mac Pro, we are in the process of what we call ""completely rethinking the Mac Pro."" We’re working on it.

This week's stories 

 Apple to host surprise event for apps and games on December 2 Members of the press received surprise invitations from Apple this morning to attend a first-of-its-kind event to honor 2019’s top apps and games on December 2 in New York City.  16-inch MacBook Pro beats predecessors by overcoming thermal throttling The higher tier MBP has the same i9-9880H process as previous model. In a 30 minute stress test, Dave 2D measured the CPU average speed at 3.1Ghz where previous model was at 2.7GHz. Other stress tests show a similar result, the same CPU is about 10% faster in the 16-inch MBP.  13-inch MacBook Pro dropping horrible Butterfly keyboard The smaller MacBook Pro will reportedly be upgraded next year with a keyboard that users can trust, just as the new 16-inch version recently was. If true, it means the current 13-inch MacBook Pro will be the last with the infamous Butterfly keyboard. This improved version is supposedly scheduled for the first half of 2020.  How a Magic Keyboard made it into the new 16-inch MacBook Pro In a new interview, Apple marketing SVP Phil Schiller talked about redesigning Apple’s notebook keyboard. And whether or not the non-butterfly keyboard will make it to other Apple laptops anytime soon.  16-inch MacBook Pro shows the advantages of a post-Jony Ive Apple [Opinion] Now that Jonny’s stepping away, will Apple tempter the enthusiasm of the design team make their products more practical?","This week: another Apple event is coming December 2!

This week's story links 

 First iPhone 11 Pro Max teardown shows off gigantic new battery One of the specs Apple refuses to reveal about the iPhone 11 Pro Max has been revealed by a teardown of this new model: it includes a 3,969 mAh battery, significantly larger than the one in the XS Max. That's hugely larger than the 3,174 mAh power cell in last year’s iPhone XS Max. And of course Apple is reporting the 11 Pro features 4 hours of extra battery life, while the iPhone 5 clock 5 extra hours.  iPhone 11 Pro review roundup: Big battery, camera, display upgrades There’s no question about it: the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max are two of the best iPhones Apple has ever built — and arguably the best handsets in the world right now. Verge says it has the best camera in a phone.  “[T]he iPhone 11 Pro cameras are an enormous improvement over the XS, and they beat the Pixel and Samsung’s Galaxy Note 10 Plus in most of our side-by-side comparisons. In fact, I think the iPhone 11 Pro is the best smartphone camera on the market right now.”  Tom’s Guide loved the screen  ""iPhone 11 Pro Max’s 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display vastly outshined the Galaxy Note 10 Plus”  What about speed you ask. Hold on to your butts. Wired had this to say:  “The phones are fast. Downloading apps is fast. Switching between apps is fast. Processing and editing photos is fast. Apple Pay is faster on this phone; Face ID feels slightly faster. FaceID supports more face angles too “   iPhone 11 supposedly capable of two-way wireless charging One feature we expected but didn’t get from the iPhone 11 lineup is two-way wireless charging. But Apple could surprise us with it later. Two-way or bilateral wireless charging would allow you to charge certain devices — including other smartphones — by placing them down on the back of your iPhone. Tipster Sonny Dickson, citing “reliable sources,” reports that iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max do feature the hardware required for two-way wireless charging. It’s just that Apple hasn’t enabled it yet. ""Reliable sources are saying iPhone 11 and 11 Pro do include the hardware for bilateral charging, but that it is software disabled. Uncertain whether this was removed prior to final production run.” It’s not clear why or when two-way wireless charging may have been deactivated. Reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently suggested the “efficiency may not meet Apple’s requirements.” Bizarre that Apple would not have at least MENTIONED this feature and announced an anticipated release date.  Apple Watch Series 5 has same CPU as Series 4 The insides of the Apple Watch Series 5 aren’t all that different from last year’s Series 4 upgrade.

 Students get a massive discount on Apple’s Pro Apps Bundle   Apple is offering students a massive discount on a bundle of pro apps that includes Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro X and more. The total cost of the apps included in the set would be just under $630, but Apple is offering them all to those in education for just $199. “Education pricing is available to college students, students accepted to college, parents buying for college students, faculty, homeschool teachers, and staff at all grade levels,” Apple said.  All three 2017 iPhones may get wireless charging  According to a reliable Apple analyst, the company will release three new iPhones this year — including a redesigned iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) and two iterative iPhone 7 updates. All three models will reportedly boast new Apple wireless charging tech, rather than the feature being limited to a high-end OLED handset.     The next iPhone may cost more than $1,000   The price of the top-of-the-line iPhone is set to increase to more than $1,000, according to a new report that claims the device will pack an OLED display that stretches across the entire front of the phone Switching to an OLED display will likely cost Apple twice as much as the current LCD display used on the iPhone 7, reports Fast Company. The report also echoes previous rumors that the 2017 iPhone will come in three screen sizes: 5.8 inches, 5.5 inches and 4.7 inches. It’s still unclear what Apple will call the next iPhone. Some fans expect it to be called the iPhone 10 or iPhone X because this year marks the device’s 10th anniversary.      What we’re into  The Decterists  The OA  10 Cloverfield Lane",This week:   How to get significant discounts on Apple gadgets The INSANELY SPECIAL doorknobs at Apple’s Spaceship HQ The fat paychecks earned by Jony Ive’s industrial designers  iPhone 8 to come in a plus plus size Wireless...,,d393404d14f773c5d992c895da0e9545,2D896BCB-E4E8-4EC2-B80F-2248D5A5CB95,CultCast #270 - The BEST Apple discounts,public.audio,7097299E-8F33-4DB9-BBCA-4119A45F95B3,http://thecultcast.libsyn.com/cultcast-270-the-best-apple-discounts,,

Apple Music Connect is shutting down, suffering Same Fate as iTunes Ping - lewis  https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/13/apple-music-connect-shutting-down/ Apple today announced that its Apple Music Connect social platform for artists is in the process of shutting down, suffering the same fate as Ping, the company's previous social network for music removed from iTunes in October 2012. The only band that ever posted anything was ColdPlay. Apple Sending Unsolicited Notifications for New Carpool Karaoke Episodes and Apple Music Echo Support -erfon  https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/18/apple-unsolicited-notifications/ Apple has recently been sending out unsolicited notifications to iOS users, promoting Carpool Karaoke episodes and the availability of Apple Music on Amazon Echo devices. Apple doesn't appear to be sending these push notifications to all users, so it's not clear what criteria the company is using to determine who to send content to Why did Apple just send me a notification about an all new carpool karaoke, something I've never watched and have absolutely no interest in? Today in Apple history: Apple signs ‘clone Mac’ deal https://www.cultofmac.com/458490/clone-mac-era-tiah/ This week, in 1994: Apple Computer inks a licensing deal with Power Computing, allowing the company to produce Macintosh-compatible computers. With falling market share, and longtime rival Microsoft steaming ahead thanks to its software-licensing strategy, Apple executives think the only way to compete is for Apple to hand over its operating system for third-party Macs. The “clone Mac” era turned out to be a disaster for Apple. Rather than spurring Mac sales, it just meant cheaper “Macs.” As a result, Apple took a massive hit in the amount it earned per unit. Apple CFO Fred Anderson later worked out that the strategy actually cost the company money. The $50 fee Apple got for every clone Mac sold didn’t come close to recouping the money lost from people choosing to buy third-party Macs instead of more-expensive official ones. In order to get out of the deal and top the licensing, Apple ended up buying Power Computing’s entire Mac business for $100 million in 1997. Best movies of 2018!

Cindy has also developed the ""Fraternal Clone Method"" for Cell Phones, a Forensic 4Cast Forensic Examiner of the Year Award winner, a SANS People Who Made a Difference in Security Award winner, and was named a 2016 Women of Influence in IT Security by SC Magazine. She is also one of the nicest and most approachable people in the cyber security and digital forensic industry.

In this interview we discuss starting digital forensics in law enforcement, how she started with mobile forensics in the early 2000's, moving from law enforcement to the private sector, the concerns she has with mobile phones, mobile malware, recruiting and retaining women in DF/IR, developing SANS mobile forensics courses, and much more.

At some point, I came across Compute! magazine that had instructional pages of BASIC, spaghetti code programs that you could use to run on your computer.

Cognitive Systems has developed technology that measures disruptions in a home Wi-Fi network and uses those disruptions as a way to track actions in the home. Currently, ISPs and router makers can use the technology to offer motion sensing for security purposes, but eventually, it might offer a way to detect falls or even motion as subtle as a baby breathing. That level of insight also creates privacy concerns, so Manku explains exactly how the firm handles consumer data and the steps it has taken to ensure even law enforcement can&#8217;t see inside the home.

<p>This week&#8217;s guest is Steve Steinhubl, the director of digital medicine at the <a href=""https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2020/20200325-detect-study-viral-illnesses.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Scripps Research Translational Institute</a>. Scripps is trying to recruit people who have a Fitbit or other wearable to participate in a study to detect COVID-19 using variations in resting heart rate. We talk about the <a href=""https://detectstudy.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">DETECT study</a> (which you can sign up for from the link) as well as how to design a legitimate health study that includes consumer wearables. We also discuss the use of data and data privacy for those who want to understand those things before dedicating data to science. Enjoy the show.</p>

<li>Should Google and Apple implement contact tracing using our phones?</li>
<li>Azure Edge Zones are an example of the carriers and clouds getting closer</li>
<li>Home Assistant integrations are all over the map</li>
<li>What doctors look for when building studies around wearables</li>
<li>Why the DETECT study matters and how it&#8217;s data practices work</li>
</ul>","This week Kevin and I kick off the show with a discussion of who should be tracking you during the pandemic and what rules companies and governments should use in order to protect user privacy. We also dig into the importance of APIs after Apple purchased the Dark Skye weather app. Then we explain the tightening relationship between carriers and the cloud with Microsoft’s preview launch of Azure Edge Zones. From there we dig into how social media can influence people during the pandemic, the best home Wi-Fi system, the new Fitbit, turning your Wyze Cam into a webcam, and a discussion of what we want broadband to be in the world we want to live in after the pandemic. We close on Kevin talking about Home Assistant integrations and his answer for a question on the IoT Podcast Hotline about how secure Home Assistant is. The Fitbit Charge 4 will be out on April 13 and cost $149.95. Image courtesy of Fitbit.This week’s guest is Steve Steinhubl, the director of digital medicine at the Scripps Research Translational Institute. Scripps is trying to recruit people who have a Fitbit or other wearable to participate in a study to detect COVID-19 using variations in resting heart rate. We talk about the DETECT study (which you can sign up for from the link) as well as how to design a legitimate health study that includes consumer wearables. We also discuss the use of data and data privacy for those who want to understand those things before dedicating data to science. Enjoy the show.

<p>My guest this week is Dave Crosby, co-founder and head of marketing at <a href=""https://wyze.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Wyze Labs</a>. We kick off with an explanation of why Wyze has released a scale and the fitness band, which is a bit of a pivot for the smart home device maker.
