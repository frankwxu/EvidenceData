	<string>These are ads targeted based on audience lists we receive from advertisers and other partners. For example, advertisers that already have information about you, like an email address, may want to reach you on Snapchat or other services on which we serve ads. If this setting is enabled, we may use audience information from advertisers and other partners to customise ads for you.

	<string>Snap may customise the ads we show you based on information about your activities off Snapchat or other services on which we serve ads. If this setting is enabled, we may use your activity outside the service in which you see the ad to customise ads for you. For example, if you search for a film on a website that shares data with Snap, you may see ads for other films.

	<string>Snap used a third-party ad network to serve this ad. You can opt out of third-party ad networks serving you ads on Snapchat by going to Snapchat Settings -&gt; Additional Services: Manage -&gt; Ad Preferences.</string>
	<key>third_party_based_desc</key>
	<string>Snap may use third-party ad networks to serve ads on Snapchat. To do this, Snap sends the networks a limited amount of data, for example, IP address, Mobile ad ID and whether you saw the ad or interacted with it, so the network can provide advertising services, such as ad targeting, measurement and optimisation to us and its advertisers. When this setting is enabled, we may allow third-party ad networks to serve you ads on Snapchat.
