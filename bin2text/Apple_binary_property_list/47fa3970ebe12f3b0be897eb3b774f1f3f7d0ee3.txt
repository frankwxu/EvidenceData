	<string>Cardio Fitness</string>
	<key>SHARING_UPGRADE_CURRENT_WATCH</key>
	<string>You are not currently sharing Activity from your paired Apple Watch. Sharing Activity progress requires that you have an Apple Watch paired and that it is running the latest version of watchOS.</string>
	<key>TREND_EXPLANATION_VO2MAX</key>
	<string>Cardio fitness is a predicted VO2 max value which is the maximum amount of oxygen your body can consume during exercise. This is measured in walking, running, or hiking workouts of at least 20 minutes with a persistent heart rate reading. VO2 max measurements are validated for users over the age of 20.</string>
