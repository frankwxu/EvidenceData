      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

13.2	Privacy Policy.  You represent and warrant that at all times during your use of the SDK, you shall maintain a posted privacy policy accessible by direct link from your homepage that complies with all applicable laws and regulations, and contains a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism.   For purposes of this SDK, an “Opt-Out Mechanism” is a mechanism by which an end user can exercise choice to disallow the use of data in connection with interest-based advertising (“Opt-Out Mechanism”).  

13.3	Notice and Opt-Out Obligations.  You agree that you will require all consumer-facing mobile applications to clearly and conspicuously provide notice to mobile application end users (“End Users”), which notice shall: (a) describe the types of information collected by third parties; (b) explain how, and for what purpose, data collected will be used or transferred to third parties; and (c) provide a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism (as defined below).  Such notice to End Users of your mobile applications shall be provided anywhere the applications may be acquired and prior to installation of the applications (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store), or websites where the mobile applications are acquired. 

13.4	Opt-Out Mechanism. For purposes of this Agreement, the Opt-Out Mechanism on a mobile application will be a description of how an End User can access a privacy device setting (e.g., Apple iOS Limit Ad Tracking).

13.5	Precise Location.  If you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data from a mobile application, then: (a) you shall ensure that the such mobile application obtains express (i.e., opt-in) consent from End Users; and (b) the applicable mobile application’s privacy policy must disclose such information collection, processing or disclosure.  Where you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data for Cross-App Advertising from a mobile application, you shall ensure that such mobile application prominently posts notice to End Users: (a) that End Users’ precise geolocation data may be shared with third parties; and (b) the purposes for which such data may be used, including Cross-App Advertising.  “Precise Location Data” means any information that identifies or is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an End User or device (e.g., GPS level latitude/longitude coordinates, location-based Wi-Fi triangulation or cellular tower data).  “Cross-App Advertising” as currently defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), means the collection of data through applications owned or operated by different entities on a particular device for the purpose of delivering advertising based on the preferences or interests known or inferred from the data collected, or as may be amended by the NAI from time to time.

14.	DISCLAIMERS. THE SDK AS WELL AS ALL SERVICES, SOFTWARE, MATERIALS, AND TECHNOLOGY PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AOL, OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND EMPLOYEES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, UN-INTERRUPTION, AND/OR SYSTEM INTEGRATION. AOL, OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND EMPLOYEES MAKE NO WARRANTY ABOUT THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, QUALITY, OR TIMELINESS OF THE SDK, OR THAT PROBLEMS WITH THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SDK ARE FREE OF VIRUSES AND OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT THEY WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.

15.	LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND CONTENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE SDK IF YOU AGREE TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY TO YOU AND TO THIRD PARTIES. IN NO EVENT WILL AOL, ITS PARENT, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LIKE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, LOST PROFITS, GOODWILL, LOST OPPORTUNITIES AND INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE SDK OR THESE TERMS, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE AND CLARITY ONLY, DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA, LOST EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, OR RESULTING FROM THE USE OR ACCESS TO, OR THE INABILITY TO USE OR TO USE THE SDK. THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF ANY CLAIM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AOL IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

16.	EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION BY US OF THIS AGREEMENT IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SDK. IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS UNENFORCEABLE, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent that we may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit our liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of our liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.

17.	FORCE MAJEURE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DELAY OR FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE RESULTING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM ACTS OF NATURE, FORCES, OR CAUSES BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INTERNET FAILURES, COMPUTER EQUIPMENT FAILURES, TELECOMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT FAILURES, OTHER EQUIPMENT FAILURES, ELECTRICAL POWER FAILURES, STRIKES, LABOR DISPUTES, RIOTS, INSURRECTIONS, CIVIL DISTURBANCES, SHORTAGES OF LABOR OR MATERIALS, FIRES, FLOODS, STORMS, EXPLOSIONS, ACTS OF GOD, WAR, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, ORDERS OF DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN COURTS OR TRIBUNALS, OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THIRD PARTIES.

18.	Indemnification. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless AOL, our officers, directors, co-branders and other partners, employees, consultants and agents, from and against any and all third-party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from (i) any Content you submit, post or transmit through the SDK, (ii) your use of the SDK, (iii) your violation of this Agreement, (iv) your violation of any rights of any other person or entity, or (v) any viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other similar harmful or deleterious programming routines input by you into the SDK.

19.	Electronic Communications.  For contractual purposes, you (i) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form; and (ii) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, documents, disclosures, and other communications ("Communications") that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such Communications would satisfy if it were in a writing. Your consent to receive Communications and do business electronically, and our agreement to do so, applies to all of your interactions and transactions with us. The foregoing does not affect your non-waiveable rights. You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting us in the manner described below. If you withdraw your consent, from that time forward, you must stop using the SDK. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legal validity and enforceability of any obligations or any electronic Communications provided or business transacted between us prior to the time you withdraw your consent. Please keep us informed of any changes in your email or mailing address so that you continue to receive all Communications without interruption.

20.	General Terms. You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. This Agreement and the relationship between you and AOL will be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any choice of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of a different country or state. Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or your use of the SDK must be instituted exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Baltimore, Maryland and in no other jurisdiction. You further consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in, and agree to service of process issued or authorized by, any such court. This Agreement is personal to you, and you may not transfer, assign or delegate your right and/or duties under this Agreement to anyone else and any attempted assignment or delegation is void. You acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder. The paragraph headings in this Agreement, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make this Agreement easier to read and have no binding effect. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements, other than your mobile advertising agreement with AOL. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. YOU AND AOL AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE, SERVICES OR AOL PLATFORM MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

You agree not to reproduce, disseminate, sell, distribute or commercially exploit any such confidential information of AOL in any manner.  These non-disclosure obligations shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.  

10.	Geographical Restrictions. We make no representation that all of the SDK is appropriate or available for use in locations outside the United States or all territories within the United States. If you choose to use the SDK, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.

13.2	Privacy Policy.  You represent and warrant that at all times during your use of the SDK, you shall maintain a posted privacy policy accessible by direct link from your homepage that complies with all applicable laws and regulations, and contains a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism.   For purposes of this SDK, an “Opt-Out Mechanism” is a mechanism by which an end user can exercise choice to disallow the use of data in connection with interest-based advertising (“Opt-Out Mechanism”).  

13.3	Notice and Opt-Out Obligations.  You agree that you will require all consumer-facing mobile applications to clearly and conspicuously provide notice to mobile application end users (“End Users”), which notice shall: (a) describe the types of information collected by third parties; (b) explain how, and for what purpose, data collected will be used or transferred to third parties; and (c) provide a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism (as defined below).  Such notice to End Users of your mobile applications shall be provided anywhere the applications may be acquired and prior to installation of the applications (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store), or websites where the mobile applications are acquired. 

13.4	Opt-Out Mechanism. For purposes of this Agreement, the Opt-Out Mechanism on a mobile application will be a description of how an End User can access a privacy device setting (e.g., Apple iOS Limit Ad Tracking).

13.5	Precise Location.  If you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data from a mobile application, then: (a) you shall ensure that the such mobile application obtains express (i.e., opt-in) consent from End Users; and (b) the applicable mobile application’s privacy policy must disclose such information collection, processing or disclosure.  Where you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data for Cross-App Advertising from a mobile application, you shall ensure that such mobile application prominently posts notice to End Users: (a) that End Users’ precise geolocation data may be shared with third parties; and (b) the purposes for which such data may be used, including Cross-App Advertising.  “Precise Location Data” means any information that identifies or is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an End User or device (e.g., GPS level latitude/longitude coordinates, location-based Wi-Fi triangulation or cellular tower data).  “Cross-App Advertising” as currently defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), means the collection of data through applications owned or operated by different entities on a particular device for the purpose of delivering advertising based on the preferences or interests known or inferred from the data collected, or as may be amended by the NAI from time to time.

14.	DISCLAIMERS. THE SDK AS WELL AS ALL SERVICES, SOFTWARE, MATERIALS, AND TECHNOLOGY PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF ANY CLAIM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AOL IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

16.	EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION BY US OF THIS AGREEMENT IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SDK. IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS UNENFORCEABLE, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent that we may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit our liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of our liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.

17.	FORCE MAJEURE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DELAY OR FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE RESULTING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM ACTS OF NATURE, FORCES, OR CAUSES BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INTERNET FAILURES, COMPUTER EQUIPMENT FAILURES, TELECOMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT FAILURES, OTHER EQUIPMENT FAILURES, ELECTRICAL POWER FAILURES, STRIKES, LABOR DISPUTES, RIOTS, INSURRECTIONS, CIVIL DISTURBANCES, SHORTAGES OF LABOR OR MATERIALS, FIRES, FLOODS, STORMS, EXPLOSIONS, ACTS OF GOD, WAR, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, ORDERS OF DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN COURTS OR TRIBUNALS, OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THIRD PARTIES.

The foregoing does not affect your non-waiveable rights. You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting us in the manner described below. If you withdraw your consent, from that time forward, you must stop using the SDK. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legal validity and enforceability of any obligations or any electronic Communications provided or business transacted between us prior to the time you withdraw your consent. Please keep us informed of any changes in your email or mailing address so that you continue to receive all Communications without interruption.

20.	General Terms. You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. This Agreement and the relationship between you and AOL will be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any choice of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of a different country or state.

You further consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in, and agree to service of process issued or authorized by, any such court. This Agreement is personal to you, and you may not transfer, assign or delegate your right and/or duties under this Agreement to anyone else and any attempted assignment or delegation is void. You acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder. The paragraph headings in this Agreement, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make this Agreement easier to read and have no binding effect. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements, other than your mobile advertising agreement with AOL. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

The paragraph headings in this Agreement, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make this Agreement easier to read and have no binding effect. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements, other than your mobile advertising agreement with AOL. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

For purposes of this SDK, an “Opt-Out Mechanism” is a mechanism by which an end user can exercise choice to disallow the use of data in connection with interest-based advertising (“Opt-Out Mechanism”).  

13.3	Notice and Opt-Out Obligations.  You agree that you will require all consumer-facing mobile applications to clearly and conspicuously provide notice to mobile application end users (“End Users”), which notice shall: (a) describe the types of information collected by third parties; (b) explain how, and for what purpose, data collected will be used or transferred to third parties; and (c) provide a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism (as defined below).

13.4	Opt-Out Mechanism. For purposes of this Agreement, the Opt-Out Mechanism on a mobile application will be a description of how an End User can access a privacy device setting (e.g., Apple iOS Limit Ad Tracking).

13.5	Precise Location.  If you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data from a mobile application, then: (a) you shall ensure that the such mobile application obtains express (i.e., opt-in) consent from End Users; and (b) the applicable mobile application’s privacy policy must disclose such information collection, processing or disclosure.

13.2	Privacy Policy.  You represent and warrant that at all times during your use of the SDK, you shall maintain a posted privacy policy accessible by direct link from your homepage that complies with all applicable laws and regulations, and contains a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism.   For purposes of this SDK, an “Opt-Out Mechanism” is a mechanism by which an end user can exercise choice to disallow the use of data in connection with interest-based advertising (“Opt-Out Mechanism”).  

13.3	Notice and Opt-Out Obligations.  You agree that you will require all consumer-facing mobile applications to clearly and conspicuously provide notice to mobile application end users (“End Users”), which notice shall: (a) describe the types of information collected by third parties; (b) explain how, and for what purpose, data collected will be used or transferred to third parties; and (c) provide a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism (as defined below).  Such notice to End Users of your mobile applications shall be provided anywhere the applications may be acquired and prior to installation of the applications (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store), or websites where the mobile applications are acquired. 

13.4	Opt-Out Mechanism. For purposes of this Agreement, the Opt-Out Mechanism on a mobile application will be a description of how an End User can access a privacy device setting (e.g., Apple iOS Limit Ad Tracking).

13.5	Precise Location.  If you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data from a mobile application, then: (a) you shall ensure that the such mobile application obtains express (i.e., opt-in) consent from End Users; and (b) the applicable mobile application’s privacy policy must disclose such information collection, processing or disclosure.  Where you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data for Cross-App Advertising from a mobile application, you shall ensure that such mobile application prominently posts notice to End Users: (a) that End Users’ precise geolocation data may be shared with third parties; and (b) the purposes for which such data may be used, including Cross-App Advertising.  “Precise Location Data” means any information that identifies or is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an End User or device (e.g., GPS level latitude/longitude coordinates, location-based Wi-Fi triangulation or cellular tower data).  “Cross-App Advertising” as currently defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), means the collection of data through applications owned or operated by different entities on a particular device for the purpose of delivering advertising based on the preferences or interests known or inferred from the data collected, or as may be amended by the NAI from time to time.

THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF ANY CLAIM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AOL IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

16.	EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION BY US OF THIS AGREEMENT IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SDK. IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS UNENFORCEABLE, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00).

The foregoing does not affect your non-waiveable rights. You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting us in the manner described below. If you withdraw your consent, from that time forward, you must stop using the SDK. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legal validity and enforceability of any obligations or any electronic Communications provided or business transacted between us prior to the time you withdraw your consent.

20.	General Terms. You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. This Agreement and the relationship between you and AOL will be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any choice of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of a different country or state.

You further consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in, and agree to service of process issued or authorized by, any such court. This Agreement is personal to you, and you may not transfer, assign or delegate your right and/or duties under this Agreement to anyone else and any attempted assignment or delegation is void. You acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder. The paragraph headings in this Agreement, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make this Agreement easier to read and have no binding effect. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements, other than your mobile advertising agreement with AOL. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. YOU AND AOL AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE, SERVICES OR AOL PLATFORM MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

You acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder. The paragraph headings in this Agreement, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make this Agreement easier to read and have no binding effect. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements, other than your mobile advertising agreement with AOL. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. YOU AND AOL AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE, SERVICES OR AOL PLATFORM MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

13.2	Privacy Policy.  You represent and warrant that at all times during your use of the SDK, you shall maintain a posted privacy policy accessible by direct link from your homepage that complies with all applicable laws and regulations, and contains a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism.   For purposes of this SDK, an “Opt-Out Mechanism” is a mechanism by which an end user can exercise choice to disallow the use of data in connection with interest-based advertising (“Opt-Out Mechanism”).  

13.3	Notice and Opt-Out Obligations.  You agree that you will require all consumer-facing mobile applications to clearly and conspicuously provide notice to mobile application end users (“End Users”), which notice shall: (a) describe the types of information collected by third parties; (b) explain how, and for what purpose, data collected will be used or transferred to third parties; and (c) provide a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism (as defined below).  Such notice to End Users of your mobile applications shall be provided anywhere the applications may be acquired and prior to installation of the applications (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store), or websites where the mobile applications are acquired. 

13.4	Opt-Out Mechanism. For purposes of this Agreement, the Opt-Out Mechanism on a mobile application will be a description of how an End User can access a privacy device setting (e.g., Apple iOS Limit Ad Tracking).

13.5	Precise Location.  If you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data from a mobile application, then: (a) you shall ensure that the such mobile application obtains express (i.e., opt-in) consent from End Users; and (b) the applicable mobile application’s privacy policy must disclose such information collection, processing or disclosure.  Where you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data for Cross-App Advertising from a mobile application, you shall ensure that such mobile application prominently posts notice to End Users: (a) that End Users’ precise geolocation data may be shared with third parties; and (b) the purposes for which such data may be used, including Cross-App Advertising.  “Precise Location Data” means any information that identifies or is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an End User or device (e.g., GPS level latitude/longitude coordinates, location-based Wi-Fi triangulation or cellular tower data).  “Cross-App Advertising” as currently defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), means the collection of data through applications owned or operated by different entities on a particular device for the purpose of delivering advertising based on the preferences or interests known or inferred from the data collected, or as may be amended by the NAI from time to time.

IN NO EVENT WILL AOL, ITS PARENT, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LIKE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, LOST PROFITS, GOODWILL, LOST OPPORTUNITIES AND INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE SDK OR THESE TERMS, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE AND CLARITY ONLY, DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA, LOST EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, OR RESULTING FROM THE USE OR ACCESS TO, OR THE INABILITY TO USE OR TO USE THE SDK. THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF ANY CLAIM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AOL IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

16.	EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION BY US OF THIS AGREEMENT IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SDK. IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS UNENFORCEABLE, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you.

The foregoing does not affect your non-waiveable rights. You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting us in the manner described below. If you withdraw your consent, from that time forward, you must stop using the SDK.

20.	General Terms. You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws.

The paragraph headings in this Agreement, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make this Agreement easier to read and have no binding effect. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements, other than your mobile advertising agreement with AOL. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

You agree that you will require all consumer-facing mobile applications to clearly and conspicuously provide notice to mobile application end users (“End Users”), which notice shall: (a) describe the types of information collected by third parties; (b) explain how, and for what purpose, data collected will be used or transferred to third parties; and (c) provide a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism (as defined below).  Such notice to End Users of your mobile applications shall be provided anywhere the applications may be acquired and prior to installation of the applications (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store), or websites where the mobile applications are acquired. 

13.4	Opt-Out Mechanism. For purposes of this Agreement, the Opt-Out Mechanism on a mobile application will be a description of how an End User can access a privacy device setting (e.g., Apple iOS Limit Ad Tracking).

13.5	Precise Location.  If you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data from a mobile application, then: (a) you shall ensure that the such mobile application obtains express (i.e., opt-in) consent from End Users; and (b) the applicable mobile application’s privacy policy must disclose such information collection, processing or disclosure.  Where you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data for Cross-App Advertising from a mobile application, you shall ensure that such mobile application prominently posts notice to End Users: (a) that End Users’ precise geolocation data may be shared with third parties; and (b) the purposes for which such data may be used, including Cross-App Advertising.  “Precise Location Data” means any information that identifies or is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an End User or device (e.g., GPS level latitude/longitude coordinates, location-based Wi-Fi triangulation or cellular tower data).  “Cross-App Advertising” as currently defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), means the collection of data through applications owned or operated by different entities on a particular device for the purpose of delivering advertising based on the preferences or interests known or inferred from the data collected, or as may be amended by the NAI from time to time.

14.	DISCLAIMERS. THE SDK AS WELL AS ALL SERVICES, SOFTWARE, MATERIALS, AND TECHNOLOGY PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AOL, OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND EMPLOYEES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ACCURACY, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, UN-INTERRUPTION, AND/OR SYSTEM INTEGRATION.

15.	LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND CONTENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE SDK IF YOU AGREE TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY TO YOU AND TO THIRD PARTIES. IN NO EVENT WILL AOL, ITS PARENT, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LIKE DAMAGES, INCLUDING, LOST PROFITS, GOODWILL, LOST OPPORTUNITIES AND INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE SDK OR THESE TERMS, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE AND CLARITY ONLY, DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST DATA, LOST EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, OR RESULTING FROM THE USE OR ACCESS TO, OR THE INABILITY TO USE OR TO USE THE SDK. THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF ANY CLAIM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AOL IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

16.	EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION BY US OF THIS AGREEMENT IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SDK. IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS UNENFORCEABLE, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you.

17.	FORCE MAJEURE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DELAY OR FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE RESULTING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM ACTS OF NATURE, FORCES, OR CAUSES BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INTERNET FAILURES, COMPUTER EQUIPMENT FAILURES, TELECOMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT FAILURES, OTHER EQUIPMENT FAILURES, ELECTRICAL POWER FAILURES, STRIKES, LABOR DISPUTES, RIOTS, INSURRECTIONS, CIVIL DISTURBANCES, SHORTAGES OF LABOR OR MATERIALS, FIRES, FLOODS, STORMS, EXPLOSIONS, ACTS OF GOD, WAR, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, ORDERS OF DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN COURTS OR TRIBUNALS, OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THIRD PARTIES.

18.	Indemnification. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless AOL, our officers, directors, co-branders and other partners, employees, consultants and agents, from and against any and all third-party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from (i) any Content you submit, post or transmit through the SDK, (ii) your use of the SDK, (iii) your violation of this Agreement, (iv) your violation of any rights of any other person or entity, or (v) any viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other similar harmful or deleterious programming routines input by you into the SDK.

The foregoing does not affect your non-waiveable rights. You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting us in the manner described below. If you withdraw your consent, from that time forward, you must stop using the SDK. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legal validity and enforceability of any obligations or any electronic Communications provided or business transacted between us prior to the time you withdraw your consent. Please keep us informed of any changes in your email or mailing address so that you continue to receive all Communications without interruption.

20.	General Terms. You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. This Agreement and the relationship between you and AOL will be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any choice of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of a different country or state.

If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

You represent and warrant that at all times during your use of the SDK, you shall maintain a posted privacy policy accessible by direct link from your homepage that complies with all applicable laws and regulations, and contains a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism.   For purposes of this SDK, an “Opt-Out Mechanism” is a mechanism by which an end user can exercise choice to disallow the use of data in connection with interest-based advertising (“Opt-Out Mechanism”).  

13.3	Notice and Opt-Out Obligations.  You agree that you will require all consumer-facing mobile applications to clearly and conspicuously provide notice to mobile application end users (“End Users”), which notice shall: (a) describe the types of information collected by third parties; (b) explain how, and for what purpose, data collected will be used or transferred to third parties; and (c) provide a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism (as defined below).

The foregoing does not affect your non-waiveable rights. You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting us in the manner described below. If you withdraw your consent, from that time forward, you must stop using the SDK.

20.	General Terms. You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. This Agreement and the relationship between you and AOL will be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any choice of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of a different country or state.

You acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder. The paragraph headings in this Agreement, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make this Agreement easier to read and have no binding effect. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements, other than your mobile advertising agreement with AOL. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. YOU AND AOL AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE, SERVICES OR AOL PLATFORM MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

13.2	Privacy Policy.  You represent and warrant that at all times during your use of the SDK, you shall maintain a posted privacy policy accessible by direct link from your homepage that complies with all applicable laws and regulations, and contains a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism.   For purposes of this SDK, an “Opt-Out Mechanism” is a mechanism by which an end user can exercise choice to disallow the use of data in connection with interest-based advertising (“Opt-Out Mechanism”).  

13.3	Notice and Opt-Out Obligations.  You agree that you will require all consumer-facing mobile applications to clearly and conspicuously provide notice to mobile application end users (“End Users”), which notice shall: (a) describe the types of information collected by third parties; (b) explain how, and for what purpose, data collected will be used or transferred to third parties; and (c) provide a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism (as defined below).  Such notice to End Users of your mobile applications shall be provided anywhere the applications may be acquired and prior to installation of the applications (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store), or websites where the mobile applications are acquired. 

13.4	Opt-Out Mechanism. For purposes of this Agreement, the Opt-Out Mechanism on a mobile application will be a description of how an End User can access a privacy device setting (e.g., Apple iOS Limit Ad Tracking).

13.5	Precise Location.  If you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data from a mobile application, then: (a) you shall ensure that the such mobile application obtains express (i.e., opt-in) consent from End Users; and (b) the applicable mobile application’s privacy policy must disclose such information collection, processing or disclosure.  Where you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data for Cross-App Advertising from a mobile application, you shall ensure that such mobile application prominently posts notice to End Users: (a) that End Users’ precise geolocation data may be shared with third parties; and (b) the purposes for which such data may be used, including Cross-App Advertising.  “Precise Location Data” means any information that identifies or is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an End User or device (e.g., GPS level latitude/longitude coordinates, location-based Wi-Fi triangulation or cellular tower data).  “Cross-App Advertising” as currently defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), means the collection of data through applications owned or operated by different entities on a particular device for the purpose of delivering advertising based on the preferences or interests known or inferred from the data collected, or as may be amended by the NAI from time to time.

THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF ANY CLAIM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AOL IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

16.	EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION BY US OF THIS AGREEMENT IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SDK. IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS UNENFORCEABLE, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages.

9.	Confidential Information. You will safeguard, protect, respect, and maintain as confidential the SDK, the underlying computer code to which you may obtain or receive access, and the functional or technical design, logic, or other internal routines or workings of the SDK, which are considered confidential and proprietary to AOL.  You agree not to reproduce, disseminate, sell, distribute or commercially exploit any such confidential information of AOL in any manner.  These non-disclosure obligations shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.  

10.	Geographical Restrictions. We make no representation that all of the SDK is appropriate or available for use in locations outside the United States or all territories within the United States. If you choose to use the SDK, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.

11.	Modification of the SDK. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the SDK with or without notice to you. We will not be liable to you or any third party should we exercise our right to modify or discontinue the SDK. If you object to any such changes, your sole recourse will be to cease use of the SDK. YOU AGREE THAT WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCESS TO THE SDK.

12.	Termination. You acknowledge and agree that we, at our sole discretion, may terminate your use of the SDK without prior notice for any reason at any time. You agree that we shall not be liable to You or any third party for termination of your access to the SDK. In the event of any termination, you will immediately cease use of the SDK.  

13.	Representations and Warranties.  

13.1	General.  Each party represents and warrants to the other party that (i) it has all necessary rights, powers, and authorities necessary to enter into this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder; and (ii) it will comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations (including self-regulatory codes), and policies in connection with performance of its obligations hereunder and use of the SDK, including without limitation any laws, rules, regulations or policies relating to privacy or the use of personally-identifiable information.

13.2	Privacy Policy.  You represent and warrant that at all times during your use of the SDK, you shall maintain a posted privacy policy accessible by direct link from your homepage that complies with all applicable laws and regulations, and contains a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism.   For purposes of this SDK, an “Opt-Out Mechanism” is a mechanism by which an end user can exercise choice to disallow the use of data in connection with interest-based advertising (“Opt-Out Mechanism”).  

13.3	Notice and Opt-Out Obligations.  You agree that you will require all consumer-facing mobile applications to clearly and conspicuously provide notice to mobile application end users (“End Users”), which notice shall: (a) describe the types of information collected by third parties; (b) explain how, and for what purpose, data collected will be used or transferred to third parties; and (c) provide a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism (as defined below).  Such notice to End Users of your mobile applications shall be provided anywhere the applications may be acquired and prior to installation of the applications (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store), or websites where the mobile applications are acquired. 

13.4	Opt-Out Mechanism. For purposes of this Agreement, the Opt-Out Mechanism on a mobile application will be a description of how an End User can access a privacy device setting (e.g., Apple iOS Limit Ad Tracking).

13.5	Precise Location.  If you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data from a mobile application, then: (a) you shall ensure that the such mobile application obtains express (i.e., opt-in) consent from End Users; and (b) the applicable mobile application’s privacy policy must disclose such information collection, processing or disclosure.  Where you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data for Cross-App Advertising from a mobile application, you shall ensure that such mobile application prominently posts notice to End Users: (a) that End Users’ precise geolocation data may be shared with third parties; and (b) the purposes for which such data may be used, including Cross-App Advertising.  “Precise Location Data” means any information that identifies or is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an End User or device (e.g., GPS level latitude/longitude coordinates, location-based Wi-Fi triangulation or cellular tower data).  “Cross-App Advertising” as currently defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), means the collection of data through applications owned or operated by different entities on a particular device for the purpose of delivering advertising based on the preferences or interests known or inferred from the data collected, or as may be amended by the NAI from time to time.

14.	DISCLAIMERS. THE SDK AS WELL AS ALL SERVICES, SOFTWARE, MATERIALS, AND TECHNOLOGY PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF ANY CLAIM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AOL IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

16.	EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION BY US OF THIS AGREEMENT IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SDK. IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS UNENFORCEABLE, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent that we may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit our liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of our liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.

17.	FORCE MAJEURE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY DELAY OR FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE RESULTING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM ACTS OF NATURE, FORCES, OR CAUSES BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INTERNET FAILURES, COMPUTER EQUIPMENT FAILURES, TELECOMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT FAILURES, OTHER EQUIPMENT FAILURES, ELECTRICAL POWER FAILURES, STRIKES, LABOR DISPUTES, RIOTS, INSURRECTIONS, CIVIL DISTURBANCES, SHORTAGES OF LABOR OR MATERIALS, FIRES, FLOODS, STORMS, EXPLOSIONS, ACTS OF GOD, WAR, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, ORDERS OF DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN COURTS OR TRIBUNALS, OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF THIRD PARTIES.

18.	Indemnification. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless AOL, our officers, directors, co-branders and other partners, employees, consultants and agents, from and against any and all third-party claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from (i) any Content you submit, post or transmit through the SDK, (ii) your use of the SDK, (iii) your violation of this Agreement, (iv) your violation of any rights of any other person or entity, or (v) any viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other similar harmful or deleterious programming routines input by you into the SDK.

Your consent to receive Communications and do business electronically, and our agreement to do so, applies to all of your interactions and transactions with us. The foregoing does not affect your non-waiveable rights. You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting us in the manner described below. If you withdraw your consent, from that time forward, you must stop using the SDK. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legal validity and enforceability of any obligations or any electronic Communications provided or business transacted between us prior to the time you withdraw your consent. Please keep us informed of any changes in your email or mailing address so that you continue to receive all Communications without interruption.

20.	General Terms. You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. This Agreement and the relationship between you and AOL will be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any choice of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of a different country or state.

You further consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in, and agree to service of process issued or authorized by, any such court. This Agreement is personal to you, and you may not transfer, assign or delegate your right and/or duties under this Agreement to anyone else and any attempted assignment or delegation is void. You acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder. The paragraph headings in this Agreement, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make this Agreement easier to read and have no binding effect. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements, other than your mobile advertising agreement with AOL. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. YOU AND AOL AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE, SERVICES OR AOL PLATFORM MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements, other than your mobile advertising agreement with AOL. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

For purposes of this SDK, an “Opt-Out Mechanism” is a mechanism by which an end user can exercise choice to disallow the use of data in connection with interest-based advertising (“Opt-Out Mechanism”).  

13.3	Notice and Opt-Out Obligations.  You agree that you will require all consumer-facing mobile applications to clearly and conspicuously provide notice to mobile application end users (“End Users”), which notice shall: (a) describe the types of information collected by third parties; (b) explain how, and for what purpose, data collected will be used or transferred to third parties; and (c) provide a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism (as defined below).

13.4	Opt-Out Mechanism. For purposes of this Agreement, the Opt-Out Mechanism on a mobile application will be a description of how an End User can access a privacy device setting (e.g., Apple iOS Limit Ad Tracking).

13.5	Precise Location.  If you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data from a mobile application, then: (a) you shall ensure that the such mobile application obtains express (i.e., opt-in) consent from End Users; and (b) the applicable mobile application’s privacy policy must disclose such information collection, processing or disclosure.

13.2	Privacy Policy.  You represent and warrant that at all times during your use of the SDK, you shall maintain a posted privacy policy accessible by direct link from your homepage that complies with all applicable laws and regulations, and contains a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism.   For purposes of this SDK, an “Opt-Out Mechanism” is a mechanism by which an end user can exercise choice to disallow the use of data in connection with interest-based advertising (“Opt-Out Mechanism”).  

13.3	Notice and Opt-Out Obligations.  You agree that you will require all consumer-facing mobile applications to clearly and conspicuously provide notice to mobile application end users (“End Users”), which notice shall: (a) describe the types of information collected by third parties; (b) explain how, and for what purpose, data collected will be used or transferred to third parties; and (c) provide a clear and conspicuous Opt-Out Mechanism (as defined below).  Such notice to End Users of your mobile applications shall be provided anywhere the applications may be acquired and prior to installation of the applications (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store), or websites where the mobile applications are acquired. 

13.4	Opt-Out Mechanism. For purposes of this Agreement, the Opt-Out Mechanism on a mobile application will be a description of how an End User can access a privacy device setting (e.g., Apple iOS Limit Ad Tracking).

13.5	Precise Location.  If you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data from a mobile application, then: (a) you shall ensure that the such mobile application obtains express (i.e., opt-in) consent from End Users; and (b) the applicable mobile application’s privacy policy must disclose such information collection, processing or disclosure.  Where you collect, process or disclose Precise Location Data for Cross-App Advertising from a mobile application, you shall ensure that such mobile application prominently posts notice to End Users: (a) that End Users’ precise geolocation data may be shared with third parties; and (b) the purposes for which such data may be used, including Cross-App Advertising.  “Precise Location Data” means any information that identifies or is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an End User or device (e.g., GPS level latitude/longitude coordinates, location-based Wi-Fi triangulation or cellular tower data).  “Cross-App Advertising” as currently defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), means the collection of data through applications owned or operated by different entities on a particular device for the purpose of delivering advertising based on the preferences or interests known or inferred from the data collected, or as may be amended by the NAI from time to time.

THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF ANY CLAIM, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT AOL IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

16.	EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION BY US OF THIS AGREEMENT IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SDK. IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT DETERMINES THAT THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS UNENFORCEABLE, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you.

The foregoing does not affect your non-waiveable rights. You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications electronically by contacting us in the manner described below. If you withdraw your consent, from that time forward, you must stop using the SDK. The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the legal validity and enforceability of any obligations or any electronic Communications provided or business transacted between us prior to the time you withdraw your consent.

20.	General Terms. You are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. This Agreement and the relationship between you and AOL will be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any choice of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of a different country or state. Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or your use of the SDK must be instituted exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Baltimore, Maryland and in no other jurisdiction. You further consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in, and agree to service of process issued or authorized by, any such court. This Agreement is personal to you, and you may not transfer, assign or delegate your right and/or duties under this Agreement to anyone else and any attempted assignment or delegation is void. You acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder. The paragraph headings in this Agreement, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make this Agreement easier to read and have no binding effect. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements, other than your mobile advertising agreement with AOL. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. YOU AND AOL AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE, SERVICES OR AOL PLATFORM MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

You acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder. The paragraph headings in this Agreement, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make this Agreement easier to read and have no binding effect. Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us; nor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, communications or agreements, other than your mobile advertising agreement with AOL. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of this Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. YOU AND AOL AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE, SERVICES OR AOL PLATFORM MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
