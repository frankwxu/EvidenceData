* Moderators of this subreddit **do not respond to Reddit Chat messages**. [Please direct all inquiries and complaints to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRoastMe).

[**RULES OF THE ROAST:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/about/rules/)

**Roastees:**

 * You must provide at least one high-quality picture of the roastee holding a handwritten sign with the text /r/RoastMe - Phones and Snapchat text overlay is **NOT** allowed! Your hand and at least an implication of a complete arm must be visible.

 * All individuals in the picture must be holding the r/RoastMe sign or indicate they are aware of the sign in some way (e.g. by pointing to it). Photos with non-Roastees in the background will be removed if their faces are visible.

 * Photoshopped/edited posts are **NOT** allowed. This **includes** Snapchat filters such as the digitally-added flowers or dog ears. Posting multiple edited photos will result in a ban.

 * Your post will not appear until after it has been approved by a moderator. Please send [this message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/roastme&amp;subject=Post Not Approved&amp;message=Hello, I don't believe my post has been approved yet. Could you please approve my post? Add link to post here: (Make sure you link to the reddit post, not the imgur!\)) if it takes longer than 1 hour.

 * The minimum posting age is **18** years old, your post will be rejected if you look younger or if context clues lead us to conclude you are younger.

 * By submitting a Roast, you agree to your picture being saved, hosted on Imgur, and reposted to Reddit for the purpose of inclusion on "Best Of" and "Highlights" albums.

 * Your face must be at least 60% visible in the photo.

 * You may post on behalf of other people, provided that the post follows all of the other rules listed above, and it is clear that the person being posted consents to the roast.

 * No joke roasts. Anyone posting a dog, or a ham, or Anne Frank, or Donald Trump, or anything like that will be banned for 3 days. It's not funny.

 * No NSFW material. There are plenty of humiliation fetish subreddits for you, and we aren't one of them.

**Roasters:**

 * This is a comedy subreddit, not a hate subreddit. Act as though you are trying to make an audience laugh. Please familiarize yourself with all rules before participating.
 
 * You are allowed to look through the roastee's post history.

 * Never post another user's personal information, referred to as 'doxxing'. We will always report violations to the admins.

 * Never use suicide, homicide, assault, racism, or pedophilia as the crux of a roast. These subjects are never funny.

 * Please don't use link shorteners in comments (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)

   **3 rule violations and you may face a ban**

If you see something that breaks the rules, please report them or send us a modmail.

**Highlights** is an inspiration album with the goal of inspiring comedic creativity in a set demographic. These are posted when a demographic has enough quality roasts to compile into an album. Roasters who make the list, are not awarded with flair.

[Highlights I: The Ladies of /r/RoastMe](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/3s1u32/introducing_highlights_best_ofs_with_a_theme/)

[Highlights II: Dark Meat](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/4j4lm7/highlights_ii_dark_meat/)

**Best Of** is meant to showcase the best roasts based on creativity, sting, and comedic value of no specific demographic. We post these monthly, and the roasters who make the list are awarded with flair.

Remember, what goes around comes around! If you're roasting people, why not try getting roasted yourself?</string>
		<string>Roasting (v.) - To humorously mock or humiliate someone with a well-timed joke, diss or comeback. (As defined by urbandictionary)

Hone your roasting skills, meet other roasters, and get yourself roasted! Everybody needs to laugh at themselves! And other people, of course!</string>
		<string>RoastMe</string>
		<string>If you posting a picture to be roasted, please ensure that it is a **HANDWRITTEN** sign with 'r/RoastMe' and it is legible. **The sign must be visible and clearly held by the roastee. Make sure to include the hand and arm of the person holding the sign.**

Please ensure that your eyes are not shut (unless you want them to be) and the photo is at the correct rotation.

*If there is more than one person in the picture, please ensure that every single person acknowledge the sign in some way, either by holding it or pointing to it, if they are part of the roastee.* Photos with non-roastees in the background will be removed if their faces are visible.

When you submit, the picture will automatically go to a spam filter to be approved by the mods. As such, you may not see your picture immediately. Please wait for it to be reviewed by the mods. It may be approved, or rejected with the relevant removal reasons.</string>
