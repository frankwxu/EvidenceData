	<string>1. Each calling package has an expiration date. Please renew or refill the calling package before it expires.

2. If your calling package has already expired, you have also lost your CoverMe phone number. We cannot help you on this issue.

3. In rare situations, the phone number you chose right before purchasing the calling package may become unavailable. Don't worry, we don't just grab your money and run. You can select another phone number for the calling package you already purchased.

	<string>1. CoverMe phone numbers are anonymous. Your personal information is not attached to your CoverMe phone number(s) and is not stored anywhere but on your device. We manage your CoverMe phone number(s) - not your phone company - so calls and texts sent through CoverMe will never show up on your phone bill.

2. We only provide U.S. and Canadian phone numbers at this time and you can only make calls and send texts to U.S., Canadian, and Chinese phone numbers. However, you can receive calls and texts from any phone number anywhere in the world.

U.K. phone numbers coming soon!

3. A CoverMe phone number is always attached to a calling package you have purchased. If the calling package expires, you permanently lose the phone number. Please make sure you renew your calling package before it expires.

4. You can get up to 10 CoverMe phone numbers simultaneously.

5. We always recommend that you invite your contacts to use the CoverMe app too. Calling and texting between CoverMe users is more secure and is always free.

	<string>How to restore my CoverMe account?</string>
	<key>Key_6300_login_restore_a_1</key>
	<string>You need to provide your account recover information, including your master password and the Email address that was used to set up the master password.</string>
	<key>Key_6301_login_restore_q_2</key>
	<string>Why does CoverMe reject my password?</string>
	<key>Key_6302_login_restore_a_2</key>
	<string>To restore your CoverMe account, we need your master password (not the password you log into CoverMe usually).</string>
	<key>Key_6303_login_restore_q_3</key>
	<string>How can I set up my account recover information?</string>
	<key>Key_6304_login_restore_a_3</key>
	<string>You can set up your account recover information at "More" -&gt; "My CoverMe Account".</string>
	<key>Key_6305_login_restore_q_4</key>
	<string>After I log into CoverMe in this device, can I still use CoverMe in another device?</string>
	<key>Key_6306_login_restore_a_5</key>
	<string>To ensure maximum security, CoverMe is designed to work in one device. You will no longer be able to use CoverMe in this device as soon as you log into CoverMe in a new device.</string>
	<key>Key_6307_login_restore_q_5</key>
	<string>What information can I restore?</string>
	<key>Key_6308_login_restore_a_5</key>
	<string>If you have already backed up your account &amp; content to CoverMe online vault, we will restore all your information. If you have not backed up your CoverMe, we can only restore your friend list and calling plans.</string>
	<key>Key_6309_login_restore_q_6</key>
	<string>I forgot my master password, what can I do?</string>
	<key>Key_6310_login_restore_a_6</key>
	<string>If you forgot the master password, you need to provide your secret question &amp; answer and the Email address that was used to set up the master password. And, you must be in the exact location where you set up the master password.</string>
	<key>Key_6311_login_restore_a_6_click</key>
	<string>Reset master password here.</string>
	<key>Key_6312_login_restore_q_7</key>
	<string>What if I have not set up the master password?</string>
	<key>Key_6313_login_restore_a_7</key>
	<string>The master password is the only way to recover your account. No one (even us) can help you if you forget the password.</string>
	<key>Key_6314_login_restore_q_8</key>
	<string>What Email address?</string>
	<key>Key_6315_login_restore_a_8</key>
	<string>When you set up the master password, CoverMe asked you to enter an Email address. Please check your Email inbox. CoverMe once sent you an Email after you set up the master password. </string>

	<string>Common Situations:

1. If you delete the CoverMe app, all of your information will be deleted as well. CoverMe does not save your personal information in their servers. Reinstalling the app will not bring back your information.

2. If you restore CoverMe on a new device, you will not be able to get your information because it was saved on the previous device.

3. If you have set up decoy passwords, make sure you enter the right one.  Please note, each password has a separate private space.

4. If a CoverMe friend deletes you from his/her CoverMe friend list, all messages and media you received from this friend will also be deleted.

If you think your case is not one of these, please contact us.</string>

2. If you restore CoverMe on a new device, you will not be able to get your information because it was saved on the previous device.

3. If you have set up Multiple Passwords, make sure you enter the right one.  Please note, each password has a separate private space.

4. If a CoverMe friend deletes you from his/her CoverMe friend list, all messages and media you received from this friend will also be deleted.

	<string>Hi, check out CoverMe for iPhone and Android, the ultimate secure messaging app.

CoverMe allows you to make completely secure phone calls for free and send encrypted messages that can only be read by the intended recipient.

Even more, CoverMe gives you full control over messages you send and you can be notified when the recipient has opened them. You can also remotely wipe or recall messages – even add a self-destruct mechanism so they can’t be passed around!

CoverMe also provides an impenetrable Vault for protecting your personal contacts, call logs, messages, and sensitive photos &amp; videos from prying eyes.

Secure messaging and sharing of personal information, photos &amp; videos has never been easier, safer or more controllable!

Everything is stored and transmitted using unbreakable military-grade encryption - without the access code, no-one on the planet can access your data! Even if you lose your device or leave your device unattended – your data will never be revealed!

Is your data safely under cover? - Get CoverMe from http://coverme.ws/d</string>
