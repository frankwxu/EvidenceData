	<string>The crowd-sourced location data gathered by Apple does not personally identify you.

By enabling Location Services for your devices, you agree and consent to the transmission, collection, maintenance, processing and use of your location data and location search queries by Apple and its partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based and road traffic-based products and services.

You may choose to disable Location Services at any time. To do so, open Settings on your iPhone, tap Privacy, tap Location Services and either turn off the global Location Services switch or turn off the individual location switch of each location-aware app or feature by setting it to “Never”. To disable Location Services for all websites, set the Location Services setting for Safari to “Never”. You may also disable location-based system services by tapping on System Services and turning off the switch for each location-based system service.

If you allow third-party apps or websites to use your current location, you are subject to their terms and privacy policy and practices. You should review the terms, privacy policies and practices of such apps and websites to understand how they use your location and other information.

Information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/au/privacy.</string>

	<key>ABOUT_AL_FM_INFO_TEXT</key>
	<string>When you enable Activation Lock for your Apple Watch, Activation Lock and Find My iPhone are enabled on your paired iPhone. Once you request your device’s location and it is located on a map, you can view the last location for a period of up to 24 hours. If you choose to enable Last Location, your device’s last known location will be automatically sent to Apple any time the battery of your device reaches a critically low level. You can view this last location for a period of up to 24 hours after it is sent to Apple.</string>
	<key>ABOUT_LOCATION_SERVICES_POPULAR_NEAR_ME</key>
	<string>Popular Near Me. Your iPhone will periodically send locations of where and when, you have purchased or used Apps in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, to improve a crowd-sourced database that may be used to offer geographically-relevant Apps and other Apple products and services.</string>
	<key>ABOUT_LOCATION_SERVICES_TEXT_WIFI</key>
	<string>Location Services allows Apple and third-party apps and websites to gather and use information based on the current location of your iPhone or Apple Watch to provide a variety of location-based services. For example, an app might use your location data and location search query to help you find nearby coffee shops or cinemas or your device may set its time zone automatically based on your current location. To use features such as these, you must enable Location Services on your iPhone and give your permission to each app or website before it can use your location data. Apps may request limited access to your location data (only when you are using the app) or full access (even when you are not using the app). For safety purposes, however, your iPhone’s location information may be used for emergency calls to aid response efforts regardless of whether you enable Location Services.

Location Services uses GPS and Bluetooth (where those are available) along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and mobile phone tower locations to determine your device’s approximate location. Your Apple Watch may use the location of your paired iPhone if it is nearby. If Location Services is on, your iPhone will periodically send the geo-tagged locations of nearby Wi-Fi hotspots and mobile phone towers in an anonymous and encrypted form to Apple, to be used for augmenting this crowd-sourced database of Wi-Fi hotspot and mobile phone tower locations. By enabling Location Services, location-based system services such as these will also be enabled:</string>

	<string>Apple would like your help to improve the quality and performance of its products and services. Your iOS device can automatically collect diagnostic and usage information about your iOS device and any paired Apple Watch and send it to Apple for analysis, but only with your explicit consent.

Apple Watch Analytics may include details about hardware and operating system specifications, performance statistics and data about how you use your devices and applications. None of the collected information identifies you personally. Personal data is either not logged at all, is subject to privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy or is removed from any reports before they’re sent to Apple. You can review this information by going to Settings on your iOS device, tapping Privacy, tapping Analytics and looking under Analytics Data.

If you have consented to provide Apple with this information and you have Location Services turned on, the location of your devices may also be sent to help Apple analyse performance issues (for example, the strength or weakness of a mobile signal in a particular location). This diagnostic location data may include locations such as the location of your devices once per day, the location where a call ends or the location of a failed in-store transaction. You may choose to turn off Location Services for Diagnostics at any time. To do so, open Settings, tap Privacy, tap Location Services, tap System Services and turn off the Apple Watch Analytics switch.

You may also choose to turn off Apple Watch Analytics altogether. To do so, open Settings, tap Privacy tap Analytics and set “Share iPhone &amp; Watch Analytics” to off.

To help Apple’s partners and third-party developers improve their apps, products and services designed for use with Apple products, Apple may provide such partners or developers with a subset of diagnostic information that is relevant to that partner’s or developer’s app, product or service, as well as statistics about how you use that partner’s or developer’s app, as long as the diagnostic information and statistics are aggregated or in a form that does not personally identify you.

You may choose not to share crash data and statistics about how you use apps with third-party app developers. To do so, open Settings on your iOS device, tap Privacy, tap Analytics and turn off Share With App Developers. If Share iPhone &amp; Watch Analytics is disabled, sharing crash data and statistics about how you use their apps with third-party app developers is automatically turned off.

By using these features, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing and use of this information as described above.

At all times, information received by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/au/privacy.</string>

	<key>WHAT_IS_SIRI_DESCRIPTION</key>
	<string>When you use Siri and Dictation the things you say and dictate will be recorded and sent to Apple to process your requests. Your device will also send Apple other information, such as your name and nickname; the names, nicknames and relationship with you (e.g., “my dad”) of your contacts, song names in your collection, HomeKit-enabled devices in your home (e.g., “living room lights”), the names of your photo albums, the names of Apps installed on your device (collectively, your “User Data”). All of this data is used to help Siri and Dictation on your iOS device and any paired Apple Watch understand you better and recognise what you say. It is not linked to other data that Apple may have from your use of other Apple services.

If you have Location Services turned on, the location of your device at the time you make a request will also be sent to Apple to help Siri and Dictation improve the accuracy of its response to your requests. You may choose to turn off Location Services for Siri. To do so, open Settings on your iOS device, tap Privacy, tap Location Services, tap Siri &amp; Dictation and select “Never”.

If you choose to allow third-party Apps to integrate with Siri, some data from these Apps may be sent to Apple to help Siri understand your request and portions of your request will be shared with the App to help provide a response or take an action (e.g., make a booking at a restaurant or book a ride).  If you choose to allow Apps to use Siri for transcription, the voice data to be transcribed may be sent to Apple.  You may control which Apps can integrate with Siri at any time under Siri Settings.

You may choose to turn off Siri or Dictation at any time. To turn off Siri, open Settings on your iOS device, tap Siri and slide the Siri switch to “off”. To turn off Dictation, open Settings, tap General, tap Keyboard and slide the Enable Dictation switch to “off”.  If you turn off both Siri and Dictation, Apple will delete your User Data, as well as your recent voice input data. Older voice input data that has been disassociated from you may be retained for a period of time to generally improve Siri, Dictation and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services. This voice input data may include audio files and transcripts of what you said, related diagnostic data, such as hardware and operating system specifications and performance statistics and the approximate location of your device at the time the request was made.

You can also restrict the ability to use Siri &amp; Dictation altogether under the Restrictions Setting.

By using Siri or Dictation, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing and use of this information, including your voice input, User Data and other data that may be sent to Apple by Apps that integrate with Siri, to provide and improve Siri, Dictation and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services.

At all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at www.apple.com/au/privacy.</string>
